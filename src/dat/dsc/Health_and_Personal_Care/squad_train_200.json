This is very easy to take too much of because it tastes like a juice and it is liquid form and the B vitamins make you feel good . It is easy to forget how much iron it actually contains , just because it says herbs it is still a serious iron supplement , not just an herbal drink . It would be wiser to get your iron from your food , especially if you are pregnant or nursing .

A number of them sound so good they could have been `` placed '' here by the manufacturer.Look , I have no doubt that Resperate will make a reduction happen for many people who use it , because the idea is sound . It 's based on good science-that meditation reduces blood pressure readings.But let 's take a look at what you get here . This is basically a $ 30 Chinese CD player being sold with a built in `` tune '' for $ 300 . It is NOT a quality product . I used it for two months , got a small reduction in my blood pressure readings . But the first unit I received was defective within a week , and the second one looked like it was going to have the same problems . Physically , it is not made well . It 's chintzy . And when I spend $ 300 for an electronic device , MAN that thing had better be cool , and really made well . In this case , the little plastic piece that has the digital readout on it came off , the earphone jack had to be held in only a certain way in order to work , and the cheazy little monitor thing that goes around your chest is actually hard-wired right into the case , which is crazy because it is prone to shorting out . So , in short , you 'd have to be really nutty to keep this thing after the 30 day evaluation because its `` self-destruct '' mode starts kicking in about then . The company has a great $ 100 product here , but they put an extra $ 200 into the retail price so that they could promote the heck out of it . Even the headphones that come with it are so cheaply made that they fall apart faster than the units that they give away in airline seats.What you get with Resperate is something that you could have for free just by sitting in a chair and slowing down your breathing . What you DO N'T get is quality . This is a device equivalent to what you 'd get for $ 25 or $ 30 in a WalMart if you were buying some kind of electronic gadget . Cheazy and without any similarity to something worth $ 300 . And for those who believe that the blood pressure result is what you are paying for , and not the unit itself , you can get EXACTLY the same results by spending $ 20 on a meditation/breathing CD and listening to it an hour or two a week .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I am impressed with the size of this thing as it has a huge capacity , the problem is with the doors .

We did n't want to waste any time trying to have a baby so I bought this monitor . We started using it in September and last week ( end of November ) , I found out I 'm pregnant ! So it took us 3 cycles . The first month I had about 10 high days and finally got a peak on day 19 and 20 . My cycle is only 30 days long so that made me nervous ! It just seemed late . But the second month , I had 2 high days and then it peaked on day 16 and 17 . The third month , it went straight from low to peak . It peaked on day 17 and 18 . I thought it was odd that I did n't get any high days but that was the month I got pregnant . We had sx day 17 , 18 and 19 . We did not do it in the few days leading up to that peak because it was still on low.Being really type A , the third month I also had purchased cheap ovulation test strips from CVS - the store brand . And they coincided with the monitor perfectly . The only odd thing is that the test strips remained positive for four days . Whereas the monitor goes on autopilot after it hits your peak . So you only get two peak days no matter what with the monitor . I 'm not sure why the test strips gave me four days of positives but I just thought it was interesting . I am happy to know that the monitor and the test strips peaked at the same time.A few recommendations -- - if you have time -i.e . you are young and are just starting to try , you really do n't need to buy this monitor right away . For all I know , I might have gotten pregnant anyway without it . And given the store brand ovulation test strips peaked at the same time , you could just try those for a few months . I should also add that I used pre-seed all three months and sat with my legs propped up for a half hour after every time we tried . ( Yes , I looked ridiculous ... haha but I figured I should do everything I can to make it happen ) I know that 's a lot of information ! But I really enjoyed reading the reviews on here so I figured someone might want to hear my story . Assuming everything goes well with this pregnancy , we plan to use the monitor for baby # 2 as well.Update : I 'm now 18 weeks pregnant and since originally writing this review , the doctor confirmed ( based on the size of the baby/etc . ) that I did conceive at the time the monitor peaked . Given we had had sx other days of the month , I did n't know for sure that the monitor did the trick .
