When she showed up at his office during a rainstorm , and started stripping in his office , he knew he was in deep . There was no way he could resist her , and he did n't even try . It was n't until after their first encounter that he realized he had taken her virginity , and he had all but called her an easy whore.JT did n't know if they even had a name for how badly he had screwed up . Nikki had saved herself for him , and he had treated her horribly . He had tried to see her , but Jasmine , Seth , and Zane had prevented him from getting anywhere near her . He knew he was late in figuring it out , but he was in love with her , and was going to win her back.Another winner by MB ! ! I like Nikki . She is brash , sassy , and goes after what she wants at full steam . No half way with her . JT was fighting himself . He loves Nikki , but is overwhelmed with obligation , and promises made to her brother . JT promised to protect her in her brother 's absence , but was loving her instead .

He is homeless , hungry , broke and scared . He 's desperate and this leads him to a decision he never thought he 'd have to make , to become a rent boy at the local all-male brothel , the Chicken Ranch . Killian Hamilton is a 30 year old accountant . He is good looking and successful at his profession but social awkwardness keeps him lonely . He avoids dating so a drive out to the rural brothel that he just heard about seems like an easy way to satisfy his sexual needs . His visit happens to occur on Declan 's first night of work and he is the one who takes Dec 's virginity , although Killian does n't know this at the time . This was a one-time occurrence . Months pass and Declan becomes good at his job but he never means to make this a career . He begins taking a few courses at the local community college . Miller returns to his lonely existence . Then the two happen to run into each other at a grocery store and they decide to meet outside the ranch in hopes of fostering a friendship that both need in their lives . An attraction is there and soon they are dating . Declan works hard to pull his life together and build a future away from prostitution . Killian steadfastly stands by his man being patient , understanding and loving -- - all difficult to do in the face of his reality . I do find it a little hard to believe how little an impact on his life is the fact that Declan is a male prostitute . I mean of course it affected his relationship with Killian . Killian , who had little self-confidence to be begin with , struggled with the fact that Declan was constantly having sex with men who might be better than him in any and all departments . Jealousy is a real bitch to tame ! But outside of this personal relationship , Declan went to work , went to school , went on with his life with no apparent repercussions from his type of employment . It just seems a little bizarre to me . Still , this is a fast , interesting read with flawed but oh-so-likeable characters who get their happy ending in a believable way . That 's not an easy thing to say when discussing a male prostitute working at a place called the Chicken Ranch ! Considering where Declan was in his life at the beginning of the story , the end is that much sweeter . This is a good book and I can not wait to read the next installment in this new series !

A brilliant author is able to successfully `` go where no ( wo ) man dare go . '' Michael W. Sherer has managed to accomplish both in his novel `` Death is No Bargain . `` Emerson Ward , former stock broker , spends his days as a freelancer . For the most part he picks up freelance writing at a tolerable pace and spends the rest of his days in a relaxed and laid back pace having made enough as a stock broker to keep him comfortable between jobs . It 's his other freelance work , however , that seems to keep him living close to the edge . By doing more favors for friends than actual jobs , Emerson has a knack for attracting himself to danger.A year before Emerson had run into a disoriented young girl and brought her back to recoup and recover at his place before convincing her to find her way back home . Now her father has showed up on his doorstep ready to kill him for seducing and harboring his daughter who has once again run away . After escaping the near-death experience he finds himself unable to deny his help to the saner ex-wife . In the twists and turns of the ensuing events , Emerson soon finds himself dedicated to solving the mystery of her disappearance.Michael W. Sherer tackles the complexities of pregnancy , abortions , adoptions , and shady connections to a Catholic convent . Although these events are at the forefront of the novel they are presented in a brilliantly uncontroversial way - simply as details for the reader to ponder and digest while diligently trying to determine `` whodunit . `` `` Death is No Bargain '' brings more to the reader than the thrill of a good mystery . It is brimming with controversial subject matter successful in transporting the reader to a higher level of intellectual stimulation .

Their undercover assignment was fate telling him this was meant to be , and Shawn took full advantage of the opportunity to finally show Alex how much he loved him.Alex never thought of himself as gay and had even less of a clue that Shawn might be gay . This was an assignment and you did whatever was needed to survive . The fact that he actually liked kissing Shawn and his body came alive every time Shawn touched him only made their undercover identities more believable .

Shawn was a lovesick puppy who drove Alex absolutely batty and I loved every minute of it . Who would n't want this gorgeous g-man with a sexy Australian accent declaring to anyone who would listen how much he loves you ? Alex wanted to believe he did n't want Shawn , but he knew he would be lying . He wanted Shawn just as much as Shawn wanted him , but Alex was afraid of the stigma of being gay . I did feel for Alex and his struggle to come to terms with his attraction to another man , and Shawn 's sweet , lovingly aggressive pursuit of him only added to his struggle . Even though Shawn and Alex took a while to see eye to eye about their relationship , they never lost respect for one another as teammates or their fierce protectiveness of each other .

Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL : Book 2 in the Wicked series that starts withWicked Sexy : Wicked , Book 1that is set in a world of witches ( Magians ) who mate into threesomes . A fun premise from a talented author , I 'm excited to see where the series goes ... but not thrilled so far . This book was a disappointment all around . If this was another author , perhaps a new author , I might give it 3 stars , but because it 's Alexander I 'm giving it 2 because we all know she can do better in her sleep . If you are n't familiar with her work yet- PLEASE do n't start here ! I would n't want you to get the wrong idea ! Maybe her Children of the Goddess series linked below.PLOT : There really was n't any coherent plot- just a series of unfortunate events . The pacing was choppy . There was no build up of of tension- sexual or otherwise . Kidnapping is a tough angle to work into a romance . It takes skill to create an opportunity for a girl to forgive that kind of thing , but here there was no compelling reason for Harrison to do so . ( Kresley Cole and Gena Showalter are two authors who excel at turning that kind of thing around . ) I 'm not even sure I understood what the hell happened during the resolution of the main conflict . Harrison 's extreme need for independence was never properly embraced . It was as if this was merely a ploy to get the story started and then turned into a trivial event- perhaps even a childish one . I was really disappointed in that aspect.ROMANCE : There was no development along these lines either . Three attractive people ... some hot , but quick sex ... a few paragraphs of back story to give them each a little history ... then BAM , all of a sudden happily ever after ? No working together , no winning each other over , no endearing moments ? Nope , not feeling it- which is a real shame because I usually love the threesome set up . This had potential over book 1 because unlike book 1 , the men here were romantically involved with each other.CHARACTERS : What characters ? Were there characters , because I might have missed that ... Sarcasm aside , our girl Harrison had a lot of potential and I felt like the lack of plot stomped all over her . Jacob and Ric were little more than spoiled , arrogant underwear models with magic . Not even sure if either of them had jobs or hobbies.BOTTOM LINE : This was n't offensive , but barely worth reading . There are still some fun moments here , but overall a disappointment . If you are a fan of Alexander , then I recommend just reading it because I STILL have faith this series will get better.RECOMMENDATIONS:1 . R.G . Alexander 's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series : Regina in the Sun ( Children of the Goddess ) 2 . Moira Rogers ' magically diverse romance seriesCrux : Southern Arcana , Book 13 . Anya Bast'sWitch Fire ( Elemental Witches , Book 1 ) - sweet , sexy para-romance with witches , demons and more4 . Dana Marie Bell'sDare to Believe ( The Gray Court ) - sexy para-romance with all manner of fae : Sidhe , dragons , leprechauns , vampires and more.5 . Kresley Cole 's adventurous and intricate magical romance series ( never mind the ridiculous title ) : A Hunger Like No Other ( Immortals After Dark , Book 1 ) 6 . Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob ( The Nightwalkers , Book 1 ) - demons , were , vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy7 . Larissa Ione'sPleasure Unbound ( Demonica , Book 1 ) - demon centric romance series that sets up a demon-run hospital under a human city . Not as well written as the others.8 . Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters , vamps and Greek gods . The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.9 . J.R.

Vivid glimpses into the evil perspective as well.10 . Lara Adrian 's Kiss of Midnight ( The Midnight Breed , Book 1 ) - also darker , more violent , but incredibly intense .

Jackson incessantly refused to explain the situation to Harper , as also leaving me in the dark to what the actual conflict is . As for Harper , she was oblivious to her surroundings . This was especially frustrating as her `` amnesia '' caused her to forget the start of her relationship with Jackson , which was one of my highlights of the book . Not only did she develop `` mysterious '' amnesia , she immediately chose to conform to society as a cheerleader , something which she previously claimed had no appeal when it was out of her reach . The other supporting roles were also incapable of peaking my interest , such as Harper 's closest friend , Agnes and her `` shocking '' secrets and sealed fate.Cannon only succeeded in writing a story centred upon a quintessential high school hierarchy and a self-absorbed sophomore who is incapable of staying conscious for more than a couple of days . Personally , this does not suit my taste , in spite of the regular action and romance that I often find appealing . Only if this sounds intriguing to other readers would I recommend this novel , because in the least , Cannon ' s writing style was not as shocking as what plot points consisted in `` Beautiful Demons '' .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I have read several books from this author I 've found that her books are either love it or hate it.I 'm glad to say that I really liked this one.Troy is definitely Alpha but not overdone with it .

'' Never did Ruth 's thoughts serve her better . She and her friend Mandy were on a long walk , and from the east bank of the Alapaha River in southeast Georgia Ruth had spotted a house she had never seen before . Right in the midst of her own and her Grandpoppee 's territory , someone had built a nice house on the river and it was hard to spot , difficult to see unless you walked right up on it . Ruth just had to take a peek inside , but Mandy stayed back , not so brave as Ruth was in going up and looking in the windows of the assumed vacant house . Ruth was wrong . There was someone inside and he fit the thoughts of `` the shock gong of a horror movie . `` Rewis was an escaped inmate from the prison , along with another man , and Rewis was a serial killer . There was no way that he would allow Ruth to run away now that she had seen him . Mandy was terrified once she saw what was happening . Rewis grabbed Ruth and eventually stabbed Mandy and kept Ruth as his hostage in a harrowing and suspenseful trip in a stolen boat down the Alapaha River on his way to Florida . Using Ruth 's life as insurance that he would get there , Rewis takes off on his trip with nothing but cruelty and murder and a loaded gun in mind as he makes his way down the river.As is characteristic of Janice Daugharty 's writing , the scenery is described in detail so that the reader has no question about where the characters are and what they are seeing . Each tupelo branch that was grabbed to pull the boat up on a sandbar to moccasins hanging overhead , I visualized each minute of their frightening and water-soaked boat ride moments as well as Rewis 's murderous rampages and Ruth 's moments of trying to escape . I appreciate the flashbacks into the lives of the characters because these give the background of their lives before the kidnapping happened , otherwise the reader would n't know much about them.Ruth has faith in God and uses her faith to give her strength . Although some readers prefer not to read religious references in novels , I 'm sure it is not by coincidence that the kidnapped character is named Ruth . When staying with the other escapee who had found her and thinking she was safe at last , Bobby , Rewis 's escape partner , tells her the story of Ruth in the Bible and makes Ruth laugh at the humor he puts into it , but that earlier Ruth had made sacrifices , too . The religious references are not overdone , but embolden the character and the strength of the 17-year-old hostage.This is a very suspenseful novel . I read it in two evenings because I could n't put it down . I needed to know what was going to happen to Ruth . She had several attempts at escape and several opportunities to put Rewis out of commission , but her reasons for not carrying out any of these were for Ruth 's own personal beliefs and fears . She took the high road when she could have saved herself by sacrificing the lives of others.The twist at the end I never saw coming . Other reviewers saw hints of it , apparently , but I 'm glad I did n't because it made the end just that much better for me . This book speaks of many different kinds of sacrifices , and from both of these characters we see the meaning of the word and of greater sacrifice.This is a highly recommended book for its character-driven plot , its richness of place and depth of character development and its place in literary fiction .

First of all I would have given it a 1 star , but I did n't because some parts of the book was very interesting and I could actually vision it . I even laughed at a few parts because of how real the situation was . Now , to begin on my disappointments with this book . For one , I did n't like how each scene ended so abruptly . Soon as a scene started to get good , it cut right off and went straight to the next scene . Then on top of that , when it did , it was either days , a week , weeks , or months later . We did n't get full details about what happened with certain situations , and we did n't get enough details on the characters . Next , there was n't much drama in the book . We were introduced to atleast 2 ghetto chicks , one whom clearly had no problem fighting . The first was dec 's cousin ( forgot his name ) , who was very very ghetto . She was at the mall with the so called gangsta , when some ghetto chick whom he had some type of past with . I mean she stepped to tabitha straight away once she saw her with dude , and not once did a fight break out . In real life a fight would have broke out for sure , smh sad but true . There were a few typos and grammatical errors , which was n't much of a big deal since there were n't many.What put the icing on the cake , tabitha was just so freaking stupid . Yea most of the dudes she dated was n't worth her time , and were so lame . But there were atleast 2 of them which she had no reason at all to complain about . Her husband craig is EVERYTHING any female in her right mind would want . Good father , good sex , good to her , good looks , etc . And this dumb b***h let him go over internet flirting . Are you serious ? some ppl would consider that cheating to , but I 'd rather have my man online just flirting , and not actually out there cheating and screwing the women like most cheaters out here . Her simple a** talking about `` he lied about his online flirting '' . B***h should be lucky that 's all he was doing , like wtf . This s*** got me so freaking heated on how ugrateful this chick is . Then had the nerve to get mad at him for moving on , when SHE is the one to drop him . Sounds to me she wanted things exactly her way , and at the same time have her cake and eat it to . She put all the blame on the dudes , when she got upset over dumb s*** . Then the mysterious `` confused '' guy she met online , that was going through the SAME EXACT S*** AS HER . I mean they were each others double basically , and she even admitted to being able to tell him stuff she could n't talk to her own male best friend about ; And not once did she consider he could be the one . Her male bestfriend was just as dumb as her and clearly bipolar or had split personality ; because one minute he was telling her to have options and do the dating thing . Next minute , he was telling her she needed to try and settle down . He was the one that set her up with his ghetto a** cousin , and saying he was all talk and blah blah blah . Whole time he was 100 % wrong , and was shocked at the last minute when he went stalker on her . It 's very clear dudes do n't know other dudes all to well , and can give a female wrong advice on their own species . The ending had me like `` WTF ... it 's ending just like that ? '' . Huge disappointment . She let 2 guys in this book who was everything she actually wanted , but let them go cause she was obviously bipolar , NOT CONFUSED . Yo If I knew this chick tabitha in real life , I would dig in her s*** so bad , and make her feel like the dumbest person on earth . NO WONDER SHE IS STILL SINGLE , because she do n't know a good man when she see 's one , and got a huge nerve to blame the s*** on them .
