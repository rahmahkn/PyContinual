In reality , heavy metal music was still popular , but the spandex , makeup and bleached hair were passe as Stryper had virtually every 80s cliche in the book . In order to be taken seriously they had to abandon their Christian lyrics and make their music a lot heavier . I had heard of this album it had a cult following , that basically the band had broken up due to record company politics , they were no longer considered cool by the 90s breed of metal fans and moreso those who were still stuck in the 80s . Those who would give this CD less than 3 stars for supposed Christian abandonment in Stryper need to first realize that anything 80s was n't cool in the 90s and most of the 90s was spent making fun of the 80s .

The excellent opening track , The Boys of Summer , along with most of the rest of the album , is synth-driven , in a manner that is distinctly early 80 's . But thankfully , Don Henley is not Phil Collins so we do n't get some outdated garbage when we play this album now . The lyrics especially have stood the test of time . Tracks like The Boys of Summer and the highly underrated and supremely touching A Month of Sundays evoke Henley 's trademark lyrical imagery ( i.e . & quot ; that dark desert highway song & quot ; . Also we get politically charged songs like Drivin ' With Your Eyes Closed and All She Wants To Do Is Dance ( whose lyrics were apparently actually written by Danny Kortchmar ) that are extremely thought-provoking . And , as always with Henley , there are a handful of non-cliched songs that deal with human relationships and love . The most notable of those included here are Not Enough Love In The World and the satratic You 're Not Drinking Enough . Another one of the album 's main lyrical themes is the mass commercialization of America and the death of small business , which manifests itself most notably on A Month of Sundays and Sunset Grill ( the latter being especially ironic considering the present state of the Sunset Grill ) . If you 're not looking for an album that hits home with the current musical trends and/or are a fan of honest and good lyrics then you could definately do worse than picking up a copy of Don Henley 's Building The Perfect Beast .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "After the commercial failure of her occasionally brilliant but mostly tepid self-titled debut album , apparently Maria McKee decided upon a throw-enough-styles-at-the-wall-and-see-what sticks approach for her follow-up , presumably so she could perhaps give Geffen a successful , sales-wise album , but still be able to indulge her muse . So we get Maria-does-Patsy ( Only Once ) , Maria-does-Motown ( I 'm Gon na Soothe You ) , Maria-does-gospel ( I Forgive You ) , Maria-does-alt.country ( Precious Time ) , and no less than two Van Morrison covers . And while she does them all well , there is a pervasive feeling of playing it conservative and taking no chances throughout this otherwise excellent album , which is not necessarily a bad thing , but one comes to expect a risk or two from Maria McKee ; that she mostly fails to deliver here only subtracts from my enjoyment slightly.The aforementioned Morrison covers are outstanding-especially My Lonely Sad Eyes ( which I saw her perform on Chevy Chase 's short-lived late night talk show ! ) which gets an almost Los Lobos style arrangement , and she does a swooping , frenzied rendition of Young Lovers Do ( one of the few times she really cuts loose vocally here ) .

Whether that statement is true or not , you ca n't get past the fact that this album is an impressive one . All the songs are very , very good ; and a few of them qualify as some of the best unheard songs ever ( i.e . `` Philosophy '' or `` Best Imitation Of Myself '' ) . I actually believe , despite what others may think or say , this self-titled debut is better than Whatever & amp ; Ever Amen . There 's no doubt that `` Brick '' is Ben Folds Five 's best song ; I ca n't challenge that . But overall , I was more impressed with this release as a complete album . It has some of Ben Folds ' most carefree lyrics , but emphasizes the piano better than any of their CDs . Here 's a quick rundown of the 12 songs.The first song also happens to be one of the best : `` Jackson Cannery '' . I 'm not sure if it 's a personalized song , but shouts the line ` big brother got the keys / and I got Jackson Cannery ' ; some bitterness towards a brother or not it 's still a joyous song . `` Philosophy '' is certainly a song that should not go unheard . It is an excellent song , perhaps the best on the CD and best of Ben Folds Five . Its ending is awesome ; from the jamming on the piano to the ` 1-2-3-4 ' chant ( somewhat uncharacteristic of BBF ) that leads right into `` Julianne '' . `` Julianne '' is one of those ` I'm-over-you-and-loving-it ' songs . Hand 's down , it 's my favorite song on the disc . It starts brilliantly : ` I met this girl / she looked like Axel Rose ' . It could be dubbed as annoying , since the end hangs onto the ` anne ' a bit too long . But nonetheless it 's an exceptional song ; one that should n't go overlooked . When it comes to `` Where 's Summer B. ? `` , there is not much that can be said . The B stands for been , but still you may not get into this one as easily as the previous three . Also , I 'm not quite sure if summer is a person or the just season ; it 's hard to tell . `` Alice Childress '' is probably the low point of the CD . The lyrics seem to flow through the music in a way that 's not all that pleasing . Yet it 's definitely not bad . `` Underground '' has a fantastically bizarre start ; one that 'll make you wonder what the heck they 're talking about ( ` hand me my nose ring / show me the moshpit ' ) . But it develops into a truly good track after about 35 seconds . It 's pretty much a song about being different ; nothing more , nothing less . `` Sports & amp ; Wine '' is another weird-starter . It 's a fast-paced song , and to be honest I usually skip over it -- only to get to `` Uncle Walter '' . Which is probably Ben Folds Five 's most heard of unheard song ( if that makes any sense ) . I think we all know that scornful relative who tells bullcrap stories and is a bit uncomfortable to be around . It 's a very likable song . It uses some entertaining lyrics and good music to really stand out as a hit on the second half of the CD . Along with `` Uncle Walter '' , `` Best Imitation Of Myself '' is another admirable track . And as I mentioned above , it 's one of the best songs BBF have ever produced . Enough good can not be said about the song ; the lyrics , again , are genius and hilarious at the same time . The song `` Video '' also could be considered a low point , but once more it 's not bad at all . It 's an average tune , but does have some good lines . I think , when we come to the final two songs , it 's safe to say Ben Folds Five saved their best for last . `` The Last Polka '' and `` Boxing '' are both distinguished songs . There 's not much to `` The Last Polka '' , but its simplicity is what adds to its endless greatness . If you liked Whatever & amp ; Ever Amen 's `` Fair '' , then you will simply love it . It 's a good song , and much different from the closer , `` Boxing '' . Again , I do n't think Ben Folds ever took up boxing or deemed it to be a career choice , although he did almost enlisted in the army ( `` Army '' ; on The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner ) . But that does n't matter . And its finish really leaves you feeling pleased with the entire album ; as the fading piano will take your breath away.Ultimately , you will have no trouble loving this CD . Ben Folds Five struck gold ( although not with some reviewers ) with this 1995 debut statement . It may not be a perfect 5 stars , but it is more than just plain four . I 'd give it around 4.5 . And although Whatever & amp ; Ever Amen may be what put them on the map ; just remember where their road to success began . Which is right here . With tracks like `` Philosophy '' and `` Best Imitation Of Myself '' , you have songs that could 've easily become big hits . And with `` Julianne '' and `` Uncle Walter '' , you have two songs that have become many fan 's favorites . So do n't miss out on one of the better CDs in the piano-based music industry .

Why could n't it have been Phil Collins & # 34 ; .I think Collins is a great drummer ( listen to early Brand X ) . So , I never understood how he got into this drum machine phase . He did it somewhat with Genesis but really relied heavily on it for his solo albums . I think it really distracting and takes away from the power of his songs . Surely a drum set could fit in his home studio somewhere.I also think that the Collins lead Genesis was a better live band than the Gabriel led one . With Gabriel , you had to be there to veiw the atmospheric stage show and costumes , but the songs were played too closely to the studio albums with no excitement . A Collins led Genesis concert was fun , energetic and a different experience from listening to the album . However ... . the post Gabriel Genesis albums were not nearly as good as the earlier ones .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "After steadily reestablishing his place in the pop world beginning with his country hits in the late 1970s ' and his haunting rerecording of `` In Dreams '' from David Lynch 's 1986 classic `` Blue Velvet , '' Roy Orbison declared he was back and here to stay with 1988 's excellent `` Mystery Girl , '' a stunning testament to the timelessness of his voice and music , launching a remarkably lauded comeback that was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death on December 6th , 1988.Orbison had quite a bit of help from his friends on the record , namely his Traveling Wilburys companions Bob Dylan , Tom Petty , and especially Jeff Lynne ; indeed , that jangly Wilburys sound is all over the record , yet the record is still distinctly an Orbison record , and most of these songs could have just as easily been recorded at the height of his 1960 's heyday . This is especially true of the record 's lead track , `` You Got It , '' a perfect pop song that recalls `` Oh , Pretty Woman '' with its pulsating guitar riff and soulful Orbison vocal . This song deservedly became a major hit for Orbison at a time when most of his peers were doing county fairs.The rest of the record keeps at this remarkably high standard ; ballads like `` A Love So Beautiful '' and the haunting `` She 's a Mystery to Me '' showcase the power Orbison 's voice the same way `` Crying '' and `` It 's Over '' did 20 years prior , while `` All I Can Do ( Is Dream You ) '' is another perfect pop song . `` California Blue '' is a shimmering love song that Orbison finds himself at home with , but Elvis Costello 's `` The Comedians '' takes the crown as the record 's best song , with Orbison tenderly crooning some of the most original and aching lyrics ever in a ballad . The closing , regretful `` Careless Heart '' is also worth noting . `` Windsurfer '' is the weak link on the record , but is still worth noting . `` Mystery Girl '' is an absolute masterpiece , showcasing one of the greatest vocalists still at the top of his game . Listening to this record , you ca n't help but feel anguish at the peaks Orbison still could 've hit had he not died . Still , for a final record , you ca n't get much better than `` Mystery Girl .

The one impression I wound up with from & quot ; Slim Shady & quot ; was that Eminem was a talented rapper who needed to release another album before I could form an opinion of him - well , here goes.Eminem has seriously deteriorated from the potential he showed on his first album . On & quot ; Slim Shady & quot ; he was an angry young man with reasons to be angry and the ability to rap about it to a decent standrd . On & quot ; Marshall Mathers & quot ; he is an angry young man who seems to be angry at absolutely everything and instead of rapping about it he prefers to shout about it.From what I 've been able to find out , Eminem came to Dre 's attention through his work at the Freestyle Olympics . I mention this because on this album there are several tracks which appear to have been freestyles - at least to begin with . Some parts of & quot ; The Real Slim Shady & quot ; and & quot ; Kill You & quot ; I 'm certain started life this way and other parts probably did likewise . These verses - the songs do n't continue their potential - are far and away the best parts of the album.The tracks on this album can be roughly divided into three sections : those which sound good the first couple of times but then get annoying ; those which start off annoying ; and those which simply should never have been put out in the first place.Surprisingly enough , the singles - apart from & quot ; Stan & quot ; - fit into the first category . & quot ; The Real Slim Shady & quot ; and & quot ; What I Am & quot ; are great the first few times you hear them , then you hear them all the time and get sick of them ( same goes for tracks like & quot ; Kill You & quot ; and & quot ; Criminal & quot ; ) .The tracks with D-12 or members of it are quite interesting - they generally display the worst side of Eminem ( the side which involves repeated strangled shouts ) , along with the terribly lacklustre rapping of the members of D-12 . They round out the second category.The third category contains tracks like & quot ; Stan & quot ; and & quot ; Kim & quot ; . & quot ; Stan & quot ; 's only redeeming feature is the chorus - and even that is sampled from Dido - the reast of the song is profanity laced and generally repulsive ( even for me , a listener of ICP ) . & quot ; Kim & quot ; is even worse - it borders on industrial music with its lack of melody , beat , rhythm or anything much else.There are moments on this album which are quite interesting . Some of the humor hidden in & quot ; The Real Slim Shady & quot ; and & quot ; Criminal & quot ; is quite clever - but it is hardly worth the price of the album to get a few jokes here and there ( there are cheaper ways of getting those songs ) .It seems that either Eminem has discovered the world of fame and pop music or it has discovered him - either way the results are not enjoyable they just turn into another example of boring late-90s rap aimed squarely at youth and the pop charts.After I bought & quot ; Slim Shady & quot ; I could n't wait for the next Eminem release .

On the surface , we have beautiful melodic structures rendered on acoustic guitar , with unorthodox progressions .

So it 's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time .

Most production goes to the late , great Pimp C with Bun B and Bismark adding some here and there , creating a deep , syrupy , southern fried soundtrack to spit over . `` Pocket Full of Stones '' is an early crunk classic with a deep rollin ' funky beat and thick bass . Many may remember it from the 1993 soundtrack Menace II Society . `` Pocket ...

The writing and production credits were shared by David Byrne and Brian Eno , and the rest of the band were somewhat miffed at being turned into session musicians . To compensate , bass guitarist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz formed the Tom Tom Club , who were very briefly almost as popular as Talking Heads , although they blew it with this , their debut album.Rather like Frankie Goes to Hollywood a few years later , the Tom Tom Club had three big hit singles which everybody remembers and/or likes . 'Wordy Rappinghood ' and 'Genius of Love ' are excellent , highly influential dance/pop/rap numbers which sound like nothing else ; a combination of girlie vocals , simple tunes and charming early-80s rap production , child-like and hip at the same time . Their version of 'On the Broadwalk ' took the child-like into the realms of the childish , and was subsequently overshadowed by Bruce Willis ' masterful rendition on his classic album 'The Return of Bruno ' , which I play every single day ; not just because it 's a wonderful piece of music , but because it 's a highly erotic emotional statement , too . Europe was the birthplace of Nazism , Fascism , Communism and more murderous ideologies than any other continent on Earth ; it 's a decadent wasteland that would benefit the world greatly by dying . 'L'Elephant ' is sung in French and tells the tale of an elephant and a hippo who don human clothes for the purpose of terrorising the local population but - but ! - they find that the people are scared of a war which was started by human beings , and thus the elephant and the hippo do n't need to terrorise etc . It 's fun . 'Tom Tom Theme ' is just an extra bit on the end of 'Genius of Love ' , and that 's how you make the first side of an album ! Easy ! The second side of the album awakens sadness within me .

The song is used tastefully and respectfully ; Nick Drake largely shunned human contact , so he would probably have approved of the commercial 's depiction of 4 kids who decide they 'd rather just drive around on a starry night than go to some party and get wasted and laid . I 'd also say that , judging from the fact that a 28 year old record is # 12 ( Mar . 27 ) on the Amazon best sellers list , that the song is just as much a commercial for Nick Drake as it is for Volkswagen . Think of the power of a 30 second snippet of a song : without any information about the artist , people have searched out this deceased man 's music , wanting to hear it again . My hope is that these neophyte Nick Drake fans will listen beyond the title track and discover just what an amazing album & quot ; Pink Moon & quot ; really is . That song is just one of an amazing collection , recorded by a man in extreme despair , with lyrics that appear to be out of some poet 's feverish dreams .

Case in point : DJ Premier 's `` Come Get Me '' sounds like every other song this DJ produced , with the chorus full of scratches and a pounding uptempo beat while Nas tries to find his voice .

That 's the worst track on the album -- I take that back , `` You Owe Me '' featuring Ginuwine is the worst.This album gets two stars , one for `` New World '' with its Y2K scare message ( but I do n't like that Toto sample they used ) , and another for `` Project Windows '' , which was supposed to be on I Am in a different format .

For anyone who wondered if Costello had lost the edge and spunk that made him famous to begin with , one listen to this record left little doubt that he had n't completely disposed of the anger and energy that made his first albums so compelling.The Attractions make a welcome return and tensions in the group were at an all-time high . In fact , this would be the last album that Costello would record with them for nearly a decade . The unrest is evident in the songs , which are loud and have a `` live on the floor '' feeling . There 's little polish or double-tracking , just pure rock n ' roll at its finest . `` I Hope You 're Happy Now '' , `` Honey , Are You Straight or Are You Blind ? `` , `` Crimes of Paris '' and `` Blue Chair '' are all great rock songs that perfectly capture the sound that Elvis had perfected so well . The six minute `` Tokyo Storm Warning '' tells the story of a dazed and overwhelming trip through the famous city and it chugs along at a relentless pace that never lets up . `` Uncomplicated '' is a nice way to open the album and it contains the memorable line `` When you 're over me there 's no one above you '' . Classic.Many of the song titles reveal the hurt and anger that still seemed to be boiling over from the last couple of years . `` Home Is Anywhere You Hang Your Head '' and `` Battered Old Bird '' are both crushing and beautiful pieces of work that are as haunting and unsettling as they are catchy and exciting . `` Poor Napoleon '' features a neat arrangement while `` Next Time Round '' closes the record with a more optimistic , if somewhat pensive , viewpoint . However , it 's `` I Want You '' that brings the whole package together . It 's absolutely devastating in its simplicity and bite , a true work of genius that still remains one of his most beloved and acclaimed compositions . It starts off with gentle vocals and guitar before gradually building and then fading out once again . It 's epic and deserves to be heard , even though it may take a few listens to fully grab you and sink in.Blood & Chocolate is one of the angriest and loudest albums Costello 's ever made , yet it 's just honest and tender enough to keep its humanity . The lyrics in particular are rough and full of venom , almost as if Elvis turns the gun on everyone he knows before eventually turning it on himself . No one is safe and it only adds to the passion of this recording . 1986 seemed to be the year when every Costello fan got their wish ; they got the quiet and experimental side of EC while also getting a stripped-down rocker full of angst and energy . For Costello to release not one but two classics in the same year is a true testament to his vision and talent as an artist .

But to me , the highlight of the album are the two songs which segue into each other on what used to be side 2 of the album - these are & quot ; A Month Of Sundays & quot ; which is a heartfelt and heart-tugging glimpse at the struggles of farmers hit during the glut of farm foreclosures which were taking place in the mid-1980s . This beautiful , sad song relaxes into the cool , jazzy & quot ; Sunset Grill & quot ; , which for some reason evokes Los Angeles to my mind ... .At any rate , to sum up - this album brings out a wide range of emotions through really well played , well conceived songs .

Well that is what The Underground Kings did with their EP The Southern Way ( on Big Tyme Records ) .

The version here is a little modified production wise and sounds way better than the earlier version ( I hate to say this but Bun B was off beat on The Southern Way version but sounds perfect here ) . `` Too Hard To Swallow '' is a newly recorded track for this album and sounds nice and has a laid back vibe to it . `` Cramping My Style '' features a female rapper named Infinity and the beat samples The Isley Brothers `` Between The Sheets '' . The track is okay but nothing too special while Infinity and Bun B go back and forth about relationships . The next two songs `` I Feel Like ... '' and `` I 'm So Bad '' are both Pimp C solos . To be honest , they are okay , but they showed him as a growing artist . The next two songs `` Trill A** N**** '' and `` 976-Bun B '' are Bun B solos that appeared on The Southern Way . Here they are modified and have better production while Bun kicks nice verses on both songs . The last song `` Something Good '' is a remix of the first song of the album . The only differences are the beat is changed again and Bun B changes his last verse.Overall Too Hard To Swallow is a pretty nice major label debut for the great UGK . You can tell that both Bun and Pimp were growing artists who were taking chances with the music they were making , and as you can see it all worked out . This is an album I recommend to all if you do not have it . I highly recommend you look for The Southern Way EP on the internet and you can see the comparisons between the songs on that and this album . Maybe Jive/RCA/Sony Records can reissue a Legacy edition of this album and include The Southern Way EP tracks , as well as the outtakes from Banned ( tracks that Jive Records told them to remove when making this album ) into one album . Just short of a classic in my book , but one of the best for the early 90's.Lyrics : A-Production : B+Guest Appearances : BMusical Vibes : B+Top 5 Songs:1 . Something Good ( Extended Mix ) 2 .

However , when CD 's came along , I bought his two-disc United Artists compilation , and `` Gord 's Gold Volume One '' and were quite happy with both . This one , however , as another reviewer noted , has `` re-recordings '' of these tracks . I think in almost every case , the older versions on the original albums came off better . Gordon has a very distinctive voice , and when he enunciates properly , he sounds lovely . I found this in a thrift store last week , and since I 'd never owned this CD , I took a chance for two bucks . Alas , I think I 'll pass it on to a non-profit agency garage sale in the fall . Listening to the United Artists showcase recently , I decided I had `` outgrown '' all but ten or so of the 40 songs . On this item , I only `` loved '' about six of the 18 tracks anyway . In these versions , I do n't respond to any of them positively enough to hang on to the disc . Lightfoot had a long career , penned a dozen or so great songs that other artists can do well , ( like `` Ribbon of Darkness '' ) and had a handful of great early performances . Yet somehow , I have little interest in hearing him again . I feel similarly about Dylan , Baez , James Taylor and others from the '60 's and 70 's who once were important to me .

It 's too bad because this is their most developed release , their most mature effort , and their most controversial album.The band itself can explain the controversy far better than I can , but I encourage you to read the book LOUD 'N ' CLEAR by Dale Erickson and Jesse Sturdevant . It sheds a lot of light on the subject . Lyrics were behind the problem as the bands distributors ( BENSEN ) no longer felt that the band was pushing the Christian viewpoint ( s ) . This is clearly untrue from much of the lyrical content on the album-even within the title track itself . Clearly , this album caught Stryper at a tough time when they were struggling with their identity as a 'Christian Metal Band ' . No other band has probably been as pigeon-holed as this one . But for all the controversy , the music remains quite good here . There are a few lapses into the tired 80 's metal cliches , but the album also contains some great tunes like `` Two Bodies '' , `` All For One '' , `` Lady '' , and `` Ordinary Man '' . I can do without `` Two-Time Woman '' and `` Rock The People '' , but I have no MAJOR complaints outside of those . And I have NO complaints with the sound . AGAINST THE LAW is by far the bands best sounding album . Major producer Tom Werman handled the board duties expertly and we end up with the fattest mix of any Stryper release-it 's nice to hear the bass and drums even more up-front . Robert 's kit sounds GREAT . The guitars are THICK . The band even LOOKS tougher in the insert photos ! By the way , the band did not have a say in the cover concept-they hated it .

Oh , maybe that 's a little harsh.First off , as another Amazon reviewer noted , the sound has been aggressively compressed , which means , by the time you 've reached the later stages of the album , you may experience some ear fatigue . The sound is unrelenting and it changes the original dynamics . I felt like I was hearing a whole new mix . A sign of over compressing . Has the whole music industry gone compression nuts ? Or , were the Moody Blues simply worried that their back catalogue ( the big 7 ) was lacking in musical muscle , and super charging it with heavy compression is the answer ? Or both ? On the EQ front , there 's some added EQ to the bass and kick drum , giving me a whole new appreciation for the Moody Blues rhythm section . This `` intense '' re-mastering really benefited the `` Dear Diary '' thru `` To Share Our Love '' section of the album , which is usually , my least favorite part . So it 's not all bad . In fairness , their albums always did lack a bit , in the bottom end , but now they don't.One more thing about aggressive compression , this also happened about a year ago when I bought the EMI `` re-master '' of Deep Purple 's 1973 album `` Who Do We Think We Are . '' By the time I got towards the end , my ears were tired . So , recently I bought the gold disc version which avoids over compression , and it not only sounded better , but my ears were n't tired by the end . But , since the Moodies do n't play as loud as Purple , it should n't be a problem . Now that I got that off my chest ... Secondly , the `` SACD Deluxe Edition '' bonus track enticement , just ticks me off to no end . Sure , there are some good rare tracks here . The BBC stuff is very nice to hear for the long time fan who only know these songs one way . But , the first five bonus cuts may take away some of the mystery of the album . It 's like when watching `` the making '' of a movie , and it just takes away the magic if you will , at least for me.Thirdly , as another Amazon reviewer noted , the great cover artwork has been ruined by the people in charge of reproducing the cover ! The cover images have been reproduced way too light so that nearly all the detail has been faded ! But , the booklet is really nice , with many color photos , insightful stories and lots of studio information.In conclusion , after hearing a number of these `` SACD Deluxe Editions , '' I 'll be keeping my old ( 1997 ) re-masters , after all , they still look and sound great .

It was also the band commercial breakthrough album , although it was acually their second . No Doubt from Anaheim , CA was defenitely a fresh and unique band when they came out in 1995 with this one . They mixed Rock with Ska and Reggae but were also able to create good hooks on most songs and occasional tear jerking ballads like `` Do n't Speak '' . No Doubt with lead singer Gwen Stefani was some kind of new wave band of the mid 90 's just like Debby Harry and Blondie had been in the 80 's . Although they were diffrent musically , the 2 singers had something in common . Needless to say , `` Tragic Kingdom '' is No Doubt at their best and nothing short of excellent . It 's fun , catchy and with a fresh and unique sound that certainly got the attention of most people at the time.It all starts with the excellent hit single , `` Spiderwebs '' The song is about a relationship that is almost like a spiderweb and the song is a trademark No Doubt song with all the Ingredients they mixed to create their special sound . Gwen 's energy is amazing . `` Excuse Me Miss '' is slightly slower but does n't lack the goodies either . `` Just a Girl '' sound alot like `` Spiderwebs '' but it 's more of a girls anthem . It was their first single and a very good one . `` Happy Now '' is very good too , a very energic song with good guitars . `` Diffrent People '' is the opposite , a happy mood song . `` Hey You '' is another No Doubt standard in midpace . `` The Climb '' shows that the band also can make ballads . `` Sixteen '' is perhaps for a younger audience , a song about teenagers with an energic hook.The upcoming two songs are 2 of the best . First comes `` Sunday Morning '' that also was released as a single and is one of the more rock influenced songs of the album . `` No Doubt '' is my personal favorite and infact one of the best ballads of the decade , can you believe a band that sang ska-pop on `` Just a Girl '' could make something so diffrent like this one . A beautiful and tear jerking ballad . The song is co-written between Gwen and brother Eric and is about her previous relationship with bandmember and bassist Tony Kanal . Tony broke up and the song was made to cover the pain that Gwen went through . It still gives me goosebumps . `` You Can Do It '' sound disco influenced , it 's odd but who 's surprised ? . `` World Go Round '' is a mix between Ska , Jazz and pop , It 's really catchy but a typical album song . `` End it On This '' and `` Tragic Kingdom '' the title track both are solid standards that melt into the album concept well.Overall , Classic 90 's album that was and is special in it 's own way with the bands Ska revival , some reggae , some rock and pop . It got diversity , energy , it 's fun and catchy .

The first part is `` When The Dance Is Over '' which is at least respectably tuneful , but it really falls apart on the second part , the air-headed `` Go On And Dance '' which reuses the main riff from `` Makin ' Love '' ( from `` Head Over Heels '' ) ; and then there 's the mercilessly repetitive , sax-laden `` Never Gon na Stop '' part which is downright grating and obnoxious . `` Stay ( Night Until Noon ) '' is credited to Timothy B. Schmit and Noreen Schmit , and it 's also very weak with its tossed off melodicism and piss-poor , annoyingly self-righteous 'tough guy ' lyrics . The one other track Schmit co-wrote , the acoustic ballad `` Find Out In Time '' , is much better with nice twelve-string guitar work , but it 's flawed with some weak turns of phrase and sickly-sweet harmonies . Paul Cotton 's got 4 solo compositions here , and they 're mostly weak -- the vamping funk-rocker `` Win Or Lose '' is another one of his tunes with an absolutely toothless verse melody ; the uptempo riff-rocker `` Living In The Band '' has overwrought Cotton vocals and pathetic , senseless 'celebratory ' lyrics ; and `` Twenty Years '' is a tired shuffle . Cotton 's best track is the title track which has a somewhat nice dreamy feel and a chorus that does catch the ear , but it 's not particularly well-written , and like usual , the lyrics leave a lot to be desired . Young 's `` Downfall '' has nice crunchy guitar work , but the song is half-baked with annoying repetition of the title , and the lyrics are so unimaginative and dull , it 's eyeroll-inducing . Schmit 's ballad `` Me And You '' is pretty good with a catchy chorus , though the opening verse is sadly rote . Ultimately , it 's hard to feel sorry for the guys ' lack of commercial success with an album as weak as this . There are solid ideas floating around , but the inability to focus them into quality , fully developed songs is incredibly frustrating and disappointing .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The boyz from Port Arthur return after 2 years for their 2nd group album , and their 2nd best album .

Apparently when the session was finished he dropped the tapes off at the front desk of his record label without a word . From start to finish , Pink Moon is miraculous ; raw , confessional and stark .

What is most astounding about Pink Moon is that it is utterly timeless . Almost any other recording of the period , whether it was British or American , would be heard today as a product of the early 1970s . Not Nick Drake 's work . And his guitar playing , with tricky open-tunings , was so technically outstanding .

So I got all his albums and always but never got this one . Finaly I got this simply so I could say I owned all of Snoops albums . I got the album with very low expectations . Actualy this was good cuz the album ended up actualy being worth keeping cuz I expected nothing and got something ( little as it was ) .I should also mention I hate No Limit and Cash Money because in my eyes they 're ghetto boybands . This is Snoops only full on `` No Limit pride '' album by the way.The first track is actualy good exept for whens Snoops trying to rap but its covered up by an anoying `` UHHHHHHH '' from Master P who I think has no talent as a producer or a rapper . So after that song I was excited but the next two songs were all No Limit and realy let me down . `` Gin & Juice II '' is actualy good other than the very confused chorus . `` Show Me Love '' is a good song and is produced by DJ Pooh . The beat is n't one of his best but its a break from No Limit . The next two songs are actualy not bad evan though they 're by the Pound ( no limits producers ) . Than the album takes a turn for the worst with `` True Tank Dogs '' and `` Whatcha Gon Do '' where Master P sounds well they wo n't let me tell you how he feels as he yells `` RUUUUUUNNN '' . Than the album is saved by `` Still a G thang '' witch is a great song that would be good on any of Snoops albums . The next three songs are terrible . `` DP Gangsta '' is a cover of `` Gangsta Gangsta '' by NWA . The olny problem with this song is the chorus . Other than that i realy like this song . `` See Ya When I Get There '' is pritty good but too mutch C-Murder on it . `` Picture This '' is listenable if you fast forward past Mia-X part . `` Doggz Gon na Get Ya '' is a real good song and i like the lyrics . KLC is the olny No Limit producer that has the ability to make a good song on a constant basis . Than comes my favorite song on the album `` Hoes , Money & Clout '' witch has a westcoast beat and Snoops flow is very good . `` Get Bout it & Rowdy '' has a good beat but a bad flow and more yelling by Master P.The bottem line is that these beats do n't work with Snoops voice . The olny people that should get this album are people who olny buy albums for a few good songs , Snoop Dogg fanatics and those people who somehow like No Limit `` music '' .

The album is of the first wave of Wu-Tang solos from 1994-1996 following the legendary group album `` Enter the Wu-Tang : 36 Chambers . '' On that album , GZA was shown to maybe the group 's best lyricist , a metaphorical master who lived up to his nickname of `` the genius . '' This album boasts multiple classic tracks , and it 's got such a great feeling . The dark , gritty production gives it a cinematic feel , which is heightened by the dramatic kung-fu movie samples throughout the album . RZA handles the productive and it is awesome , completely fitting of GZA 's amazing lyrics . The production is very similar to `` 36 Chambers , '' RZA showing his signature style on the mixing boards . This album is only 13 tracks , but the tracks are all complete and it 's a perfect length , not at all overblown like some later Wu releases would be . Almost the entire Wu-Tang Clan makes a guest appearance at some point on the album , so it 's a group effort in some respects , but GZA always shines . Lyrically he is a beast , and this album may be his shining triumph . He uses battle-type rhymes often , full of great punchlines and also uses a lot of metaphors . He stays very true to the original Wu-Tang style though , often referencing kung-fu and chess in his rhymes . `` Liquid Swords '' is in my opinion the best Wu-Tang solo and a classic album , necessary for any fan of 90s hip hop or Wu.The album begins with the title track , which has a great organ-laced beat and GZA displays his addictive flow and nasal voice , shooting lyrical bullets . `` Duel of the Iron Mic '' is hard-hitting and well-produced by RZA . `` Living in the World Today '' is musically simple and lyrically complex , GZA boasts of Wu-Tang 's prominence and is full of punchlines . `` Gold '' is an almost mafioso look at his lifestyle . `` Cold World '' has an awesome , almost disturbing chorus and GZA takes the opportunity for great storytelling . `` Labels '' is very clever , he uses all the record label names he can think of to almost make fun of them , I like this song a lot . `` 4th Chamber '' is one of my favorites on the disc , it has an awesome beat and great verses from the Genius and Ghostface Killah , this is a Wu-Tang classic like the other `` Chamber '' cuts of old . `` Shadowboxin ' '' is another classic , a collaboration with Method Man where the duo slays MCs with their Shaolin styles . `` Killah Hills 10304 '' is another simply awesome song preluded by a funny interlude . `` Investigative Reports '' is so cool to listen to , GZA tells a paranoid view of the world and crime life . `` Swordsman '' is a metaphor-heavy representative track of his character , and `` I Gotcha Back '' is another of my favorites , GZA telling an eerie philosophy ( `` I gotcha back , but you 'd best a-watch your front / ` cause it 's them n ... .s in front , they be pullin ' stunts '' ) . The last song is my absolute favorite , `` Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth . '' This track is completely unlike any other on the album , so it 's good that it was last on the album . It 's a very conscious and relevant song by Killah Priest that tackles racial and religious disunity , looking to the children of the world and trying to find peace . The beat has an awesome , relaxing sample and a great vocal sample . I love the hook , this song just ends the album perfectly . `` Liquid Swords '' is a complete , well-rounded , and diverse masterpiece , unique and basically unlike any other album I have heard . Even among the Wu-Tang classics it shines as a legendary work , one that would never again be matched by GZA . This is one of those albums that I find something new I like about it every time , and I really do n't find that in many albums that are released today . I strongly recommend the purchase of `` Liquid Swords '' to all passing hip hop fans , this is even one of those albums that could sell rap to a non fan .

Granted , nearly every artist and group loathes to release a second album that is a Xerox of the first one , but when bands define what they want to be : metal , pop , dance , etc.. they truly do a disservice to themselves and their fans when they release an album that lacks all the things that made the first one such an catch in the first place . Yes , they have the & # 34 ; Deee-Lite & # 34 ; eclectic team of producers and collaborators to make the & # 34 ; sound & # 34 ; come out , however , the songs here are AWFUL ! They appear to be either the rejected tracks from the first one , stuff that was in somebody 's forgotten trunk that should have never seen the light of day ( see XTC Apple Venus Vol1 , and Oranges & Lemons ) , or songs that were rushed and half-baked on the subway ride to the recording studio . Since the label or the band already paid for the production team , the studio time , and the rest of the team , this sloppy homework done at the last minute is what they had to work with . No time for rewriting or to properly compose good songs as they did with the first one . The label wants another 5 top 10s by the end of the week ! ! Sadly maybe 2 songs were good enough for me to keep this album in my collection for so many years , but now I will trade it in among with my other undesirables for enough $ to buy something else . The last time a famous artist went from his trade ( rock ) to a political album , it flopped miserably . Anyone remember John Lennon & Yoko Ono & # 34 ; Some Time In New York City & # 34 ; ( 1972 ) ?

This was due mainly to the superb lead single `` Stroke U Up '' ( platinum single sales ) and the follow-up `` Foolin ' Around '' , each produced by R. Kelly . In addition , both singers were capable vocalists , as displayed by interchangeable lead throughout the set.Not only were the singles well-crafted , but the rest of the album held it own as well .

Even though their debut was commercially successful , better records would later turn up for Changing Faces , namely their 3rd set , despite not acheiving the accompanying sales .

He has to thank Biggie Smalls for the huge success of `` I 've been missing you '' cause if it was n't for his tragic death i do n't think Puffy 's , sorry diddy 's career ever would have kicked off . `` I 'll be missing you '' was more of less a cover of The Police 1983 hit `` Every Breath you take '' only diffrence was diddy 's rap .

Ice Cube destroys any fond memories of Once Upon A Time In The Projects with a weak sequel and Cash Over *** will have tapping the skip button with the quickness . The Ugly : The Pecking Order and The Curse Of Money is hot garbage . Limos Demos and Bimbos and X-******* are Ice Cube at his sophomoric worst but as bad as they are they are pale in comparison to the grotesque If I Was F****** You . Bottom Line : This album is a disgrace to the west coast veteran and is Ice Cube 's worst album ever . The production was awful ( did every song have to have an eerie beat to it ? ) and Ice Cube kept talking about the main stuff . Dont mistake this album as Ice Cube 's best and all you kids that keep saying that he stopped making good albums after The Predator need to check yourself .

Nick was no virtuoso musician by any means , but he was an awe-inspiring songwriter who knew how to entrance your senses with a simple 2-minute song . His distinctive , smoky voice just had an indescribable warmth and coziness to it that perfectly complemented his entrancing guitar melodies.He also does a magnificent job of keeping the songwriting interesting and diverse .

I 've come to appreciate his talents as true Moody Blues more than any of the others . Not to disparage Justin Hayward , John Lodge , Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge . Every one of them deserves favour as a true artist in a sea of wannabes . But Pinder best put forth the dream-like sound , the mood , the close-your-eyes-and-listen elements untethered to a 3-minute time limit .
