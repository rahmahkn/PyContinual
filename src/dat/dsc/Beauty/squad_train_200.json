Before purchasing it from Amazon , I went to the Naturtint website to check out the color chart , and then found it locally so I could see the color chart in person . Since I still was n't sure what color to get and was trying to go to a lighter red than my current color , I emailed a photo of my hair to Naturtint 's customer service email . Someone emailed me back right away with two suggested colors -- and so they definitely have excellent customer service ! This color contain hydrogen peroxide , which means that it can lighten your hair over time . If you want to move to a lighter shade , you can use Naturtint to do so gradually , by slowly going down two shades at a time . The peroxide , however , is probably what makes this so drying on your hair ; it left my hair feeling awful afterwards.That being said , when I rinsed this out of my hair , it took forever to rinse and burned my eyes really badly as I was rinsing it out . It also left my hair feeling like straw , and I had very healthy hair to begin with . Even after using their shampoo and conditioner , my hair felt awful , so I did a deep treatment with one of my own hair masques , and that seemed to help a bit . Overall , though , my hair feels really dry and straw-like , and I had a lot of residual color left on my towels and pillowcase last night , which I 've never had before.When I told my stylist that I was going to start dying my own hair again , she said just to do an all-over color every four or five or so colorings when doing box color , and just touch up the roots in the meantime . I 'd like to do so , but this seems to be so damaging to my hair that I 'm not sure I want to use it again . Before now , I was using Robert Craig color , which left my hair in much nicer condition , but was more of a pain to use because you have to measure and mix up the color .
