The keeper tries to stop the players from completing their quest , which changes every time you play the game . For most of the game , the players are searching the board for clues as to what their quest will be . The keeper has a lot of actions and cards that can impede the players , but the game is fairly balanced . Usually the players will be able to last quite a while , and the keeper will be chipping away at them little by little the entire game . This may or may not be appealing to all people.Each game takes about 2-3 hours , and you 'll be looking in the rulebook constantly even after a couple games.All in all it 's a pretty fun game , but tedious to set up .

But in many ways , I consider it superior to the game that inspired it . It 's fast and simple - no letter values , no score multipliers , and no waiting for your next turn . Players simultaneously build their own set of crosswords using a pile of letters drawn at the start of the game . If you do n't like the way your crosswords are turning out , simply pull apart some of the words , and start again . If you have some letters you ca n't use , throw them back in the community pile and take new ones . The key to winning is speed and agility . When one player uses up all of their letters , everyone has to take another letter from the community pile . With all these letters flying around , you 'll have to pull apart words and make new ones on the fly.Since the letters do n't have a point value , the winner of the round is the first person to use all their letters once the community pile is gone . Bananagrams is unique in that the more players you have , the faster the game goes . A two player game has long rounds with very large crosswords , while a six player game has rounds lasting about five minutes.Overall , Bananagrams is a great Scrabble substitute .

It 's why I love the heck out of the now-hard-to-find Heroscape . But I do n't have time or tolerance for assembly and painting at this point in my life , so that rules out a lot of the heavy miniatures games like Warhammer , Warmachine , Malifaux , and the like.Enter X-Wing , from Fantasy Flight Games.X-Wing is a miniature combat game that pits the Rebel Alliance against the Empire . You build your squadron up to a certain point value , customizing your ship with various pilots and peripherals that add to the point total . Instead of using a grid or tape measure , your ships move with a small template . Turns happen simultaneously . The gameplay is simple , but once learned there is a lot of depth to the strategy and tactical decision making involved.Most of the damage dealing and defending is done with dice . The randomness associated with dice roles is mitigated through mechanics that allow you to manipulate a die with a focus token or reroll dice with a target lock.The components are excellent , as one would expect from Fantasy Flight Games . I 'm not a huge fan of the tiny cards for ship components , but they 're functional ; bigger ones would have been hard to manage.The sculpts of the ships are awesome . Everything is proportional and careful attention was given to the detail of the ships in terms of dimension and in terms of the paint job . These are models that you would justifiably be able to display on a shelf . The artwork used in the game is wonderful too . It would have been easy for Fantasy Flight to just use screen captures of characters and scenes in the movie , but they did n't - - everything is original and it looks great.The ONLY reason that I have rated this game a & # 34 ; 4 & # 34 ; is the high cost of buying in . The master set only includes three models . To get a full game experience , you 'll want to purchase at MINIMUM the rest of wave one . That gives the Rebels two X-Wings and a Y-Wing , and the Imperials will have three TIEs and a TIE-Advanced . This still may not sound like a lot of models to have on the table , but I assure you , it does make for a very deep game.Unfortunately , assuming you pay MSRP , this is a $ 100 buy-in . I am thrilled with the purchase and love playing it , but I ca n't say that I would have bought it if I had n't been given some gift cards . If you want more , Wave 2 of the models includes the A-Wing and the Millenium Falcon for the Alliance and the TIE Interceptor and Slave I for the Imperials . Wave 3 will reportedly feature the B-Wing , Moldy Crow ( from the Jedi Knight games ) , TIE Bomber , and Lambda-class Shuttle . The game is expanding and that 's great , but at $ 15 per model for the fighters and $ 25-30 for the bigger ships , it is an expensive hobby.If price is no object , GET THIS GAME .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Unlike many board games that get repetitive and you only play once in a blue moon this game has quite a bit of replay value . While the cost of the game is fairly steep there is a lot of content inside the box.The game board is modular so there is a `` town center '' piece that you can put 4 L shaped pieces around . In advanced scenarios you can use all the pieces ( putting Ls together to make squares ) . You can flip the town center over to reveal a mansion for a defend your base style game . There is a truck piece that can be used for a scenario where the heroes need to find gas and keys to drive the truck out of town . There are additional pieces as well for future scenarios or to create your own.You have figurines for all 8 heroes , 14 zombies , a CD soundtrack to add to the experience , and plenty of dice , wound markers , etc . My only complaint about the content is the dice included ( I think there are 16 ? ) are small and do n't have the same feel as a normal dice . Dice are cheap so it is not a big deal to replace those.After reading the rules a few times it all makes sense but it can be a little overwhelming for first time players . The zombies go first . A zombie can move 1 tile at a time . Zombies must move to attack adjacent heroes since zombies have an urge to feed on humans . Each turn you roll a dice and if the number on the dice is larger than the number of zombies in play you can get more . At the end of the turn you roll the dice again to determine how many zombies to spawn ( Its a D3 roll so 1-2 is 1 , 3-4 is 2 , and 5-6 is 3 zombies ) .Heroes roll the dice and go that many spaces . A hero if inside a building can search which allows them to draw a Hero card ( more on this shortly ) .Fighting occurs when hero ( es ) and zombie ( s ) occupy the same tile . The hero and zombie players roll dice , typically 2 for the hero and 1 for the zombie . If the zombie player 's dice roll is equal or higher than the hero the hero takes a wound . If the player rolls doubles and its higher than the zombie roll the zombie dies . If the hero rolls higher but not doubles then the zombie is fended off but does n't die.If you understand that then the rest of this builds on that . Each zombie player can draw 2 cards ( 4 if there is a single player acting as the zombies ) at the start of their turn . These are cards that cause problems for the heroes such as heavy rain which limits players to moving 1 space . They can also be cards that allow the zombie to roll more dice or the hero to re-roll dice.Heroes get hero cards by searching buildings instead of moving which give them things to help in combat . One such card is a ranged weapon which can be used each turn in addition to melee combat . With weapons you roll to see if they hit and then to see if the break ( run out of gas , ammo , etc ) . If you have a hero card for ammo or gas you can discard it to keep the weapon.Lastly heroes have special abilities listed on their cards which give each one an advantage . Some have extra wounds they can take , some can take 2 hero cards when searching and choose which one to keep , etc.Its covered on each scenario card but the game can be won or lost several different ways . The basic scenario is to kill 15 zombies . Each zombie turn there is a numbered board called the `` sun tracker '' which is counted down so you may have 15-17 rounds most scenarios to win as the heroes or the zombies win . Zombies can also win if they play a card that exhausts the cards in the hero deck . However the heroes can exhaust their deck on their own with no penalty . Then obviously you can win by completing the stated objective.If you have friends ( or even just 1 friend ) who like zombies and like board games then you 'll enjoy this game .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "This toy is nothing spectacular .

It plays like Dominion . If you are a fan of Dominion , chances are you will like this game . In fact I think it is better for a couple of reasons . First , remember how Dominion games tend to end quickly in 2 player or with certain card setups ? Everyone grabs 2 or 3 Provinces and it is over . The game ending card in this game , the Thunderstone , is guaranteed to be in the bottom 10 cards of the 31 card monster deck . That means everyone will have a chance to build their deck to work well . Also the victory point cards ( monsters ) are worth gold when they end up in your hand . In Dominion the victory cards are generally dead cards during the game . So often people ignore the lower point cards and rush straight for the big ones . There are times when you will kill the monster worth 0 or 1 victory points just because it is worth 3 or 4 gold when it is in your hand.If you have never played Dominion I will try to explain . You can find actual game rules at AEG 's ( the producer ) website or on Board Game Geek . It is a deck building game . That is , you building a deck as you play the game . You can either go to the Village and improve your deck or go the dungeon and kill monsters . Generally monsters are the only source of victory points . There are a few exceptions but you can not win without killing some monsters.You start each game with a set hand of 12 cards and start each turn with 6 cards . As you kill monsters , buy cards , or level up heroes you put those new cards into your discard pile . At the end of your turn , discard your hand and draw 6 new cards . When you have no more cards left to draw you shuffle your discard pile and it becomes your deck . So as the game progresses you are adding cards to your deck which will eventually end up as part of your hand.The goal is to have as many victory points as possible when the game ends . The game ends when a player either gets the Thunderstone ( by killing the monster carrying it ) or when the Thunderstone makes it to the end of the dungeon . There are 31 monster cards in the monster deck and the Thunderstone is shuffled into the bottom 10 . At any given point , only 3 monsters are revealed . So it does take time to play a full game ( 30 minutes to an hour for most games depending on what cards are in play and how many players ) .When building your deck throughout the game remember that your ultimate goal is to get victory points , which means you have to be able to kill monsters , which means you need to have a high attack score when you go to the dungeon and some cards that produce light . You can read how exactly the combat works in the rules but I wanted to explain that to someone that was new to deck building card games.Every game has 3 random monster types , 4 random heroes , and 8 random village cards . So chances are you will never play the exact same game twice . A strategy that works great one game may not work at all the next . Maybe one game you have a lot of fighter heroes but not much magic . Maybe next game you play with a lot of monsters that are hard to kill without magic . One game you may have heroes that produce light by themselves . Next game you may have to buy cards whose only job is to produce light.All of this makes the game have great replay value . Since the setups constantly change , your strategies will change , meaning it will not feel like the same exact game over and over again.The rules that come with the game are a bit of a mess but fortunately AEG produced a new set of rules that lay out turn orders and answer a lot of questions . Find the new rules online . Also there are rules for solo play either at AEG or BoardGame Geek . The solo format is a great way to learn how to build faster decks . and unlike many games that are meant for 2+ but have solo rules , the solo variant plays very well.The game is for 2-5 players . Unfortunately there is no way to have more than 5 players now . The 12 card decks everyone starts with are the same every game and there are only enough Militia cards for 5 players . If you want to try 6-8 players the game may work , though you might need to tweak some things , but you will need more than one copy of the game.The cards fit perfectly into standard card sleeves . I have all of my cards in Dragonshield sleeves.Overall it is a fun game with a lot of variety and is right up there with any other card game . I 've played about 30-40 multiplayer games and 10 solo games and still enjoy the challenge every time I pull it out . I would recommend it to anyone that liked Dominion or other deck building games . For someone that never tried a similar game but liked CCGs like Magic , I 'd say give it a chance . The style may be different but it is easy to understand for anyone that has played CCGs . It will probably take anywhere from a few turns all the way to a full game or two to realize what is going on . But once you learn the basics you can get fairly good at the game after just a couple of playthroughs .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Arkham Horror can be best described as one thing : one of the best board games ever . That being said , not everyone will grow to appreciate Arkham Horror 's creative and comprehensive gameplay , but those who do are in for a fantastic adventure .

You take on the roll of a few different characters , each with their own positives and negatives , and work together in order to vanquish whatever elder god you are faced with defeating.This game feels like a more-structured version of D & D . ; You make skill checks , have random encounters , and you try to make your character armed to the teeth with stamina , sanity , weapons , spells , and skills in order to overcome whatever evil you might encounter .

I 've played Fluxx with 4-5 people three times , and not a single game lasted uner one hour . One even lasted close to two , until we mutually agreed to stop playing.This version is best with a larger group , or more than two folks in general . The Creepers add a zany strategy to the game ( earning a 2 education rating ) : do you keep them for a future goal requiring them to win , or do you lose them for a likewise requiring goal ? You count stuff , when you draw , so I ca n't really give it a one star in Education . The art may not be for kids , as the zombies scared a couple of them , but the adults enjoyed this version more than the basic version . ( Being horror fans may have helped also ) .If you have never bought a Fluxx game before , I recommend this one and using the `` No Zombies '' variant until you 've learned the rules ( that change often ) and goals ( that change often as well ) . You do n't get some of the Fluxx basic cards ( Inflation , for example ) , but the fact is , you 're paying a couple of dollars more for more cards .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "THIS IS NOT YASMIN YASMIN IS TANNED AND NOT PAIL AND HAS TANBROWN HAIR NOT BLACK AND BLUE THIS IS A CHEAT IT IS JADE GET OVER IT .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "++++++++++Quality+++++++++++The cards are beautiful and the words are very easy to read . The card stock could have been better or thicker , but it is definitely not cheap . The game comes in a 2-piece box , which I do n't particularly like . When lifting the box by grabbing it around the sides , you could end up only grabbing the lid of the box , and the cards and rest of the box would just fall out . This is definitely not very travel friendly . For my game , I just use a rubber band to make sure that the box stays together.++++++++++Audience++++++++++This a casual game that players of all ages ( at least those who can read ! ) can enjoy . If you 're looking for a heavy game that takes hours on end to play with tons of strategy , this is not the game you 're looking for . This is more of a game that you play when you have 10-20 minutes of free time while waiting for friends to arrive , and you do n't really care who wins . Games I 've played have ranged from 2 minutes to 1 hour . If you do n't want to get caught in games that span such a long duration , you can enact a house rule where the deck does n't get reshuffled when there are no more cards in the draw deck , and the game ends in a draw.++++++++++Game Mechanics++++++++++Although the game mechanics are very simple ( draw __ cards , play __ cards ) , when I play with new players , they try to read all of the text on each card , which sharply slows down the pace of the game . I have found that you definitely need to keep track of the amount of cards drawn as well as the amount of cards played per turn because of the constantly changing rules . One thing I like to do is have players display the cards they 're playing in front of them as they progress through their turn . That way , we can keep track of exactly how many cards they have played . Then once they have finished their turn , that 's when we resolve the turn by discarding cards that need to be discarded and replace/discard rules currently in play.++++++++++Strategy++++++++++There are many comments here that state that this game requires no strategy and is 100 % based on luck . Although there 's a high level of randomness in this game , not everything is based on luck . As a player , you are forced to follow the rules currently in play to try to accomplish the goal at hand while preventing others from completing the goal . There are many instances where you can easily help other players win with the cards that you currently have in your hand . Oftentimes , you actually help them win simply because you have to follow the rules . You must try to change the goals when they are advantageous to your opponents or try to change the rules in play so that you do n't accidentally help your opponents win . In my experience , although I do strategize to win , I spend more effort strategizing to create disadvantageous situations for my opponents so that they are as far away from winning as possible . This is just as fun as trying to win myself .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "This is a game that our family has played many times .

Experienced gamers will likely also love it . It is so elegantly designed , so easy to teach and remember , yet difficult to master , that it is a classic of its kind , right up there with other great gateway games likeTicket To Ride , Guillotine , Stone Age , andDominion . The quality of the components is excellent with ( mostly ) nice art throughout . The board is easy to understand and only rarely runs out of room for new buildings ( 10 slots are provided , but there is room in the center of the board to fit a few more in ) . Sure , the D & D ; theme feels slightly pasted on , but the mechanics are sound and it 's a hell of a lot of fun , with excellent replay value.At the beginning of the game , each player gets dealt a secret Lord card , representing which of the secret lords of the city they are playing . Each lord prefers two different types of quests and gives a 4 point end-game victory point bonus for completing quests of those types ( no two lords prefer both the same quests , though many overlap with one ) . There is one exception , a lord who gives no quest bonus , but instead a 6 point bonus for each building you control at the end . This lord is harder to win with in games with more than 2 players , but in my experience , can be almost impossible to beat it in a 2-player game . You also get dealt two random quest and intrigue cards , which I 'll explain below . Intrigue cards are kept secret until played , but quest cards are public knowledge and kept face-up until completed.You get a number of meeples ( `` your lord 's agents '' ) who are placed one at a time in turn order until everyone has assigned all theirs . On the 5th round , everyone gets a bonus meeple . Most places , only one person can get the space 's offering that turn . Two of the spaces allow up to three meeples to be assigned ( including multiple of the same player 's meeples ) . These are for gaining new quests or playing intrigue cards . Intrigue cards let you get a bonus , or mess with another player , or give everyone a bonus ( but the person who played the card gets the best ) . The Builder 's Hall space lets you choose from three different buildings to buy . Buildings offer cubes or money or intrigue cards beyond and better than the spaces on the board . They cost 4-8 money each . When you buy one , it is instantly available for use by all players . Whoever assigns their meple to the building space gets its offerings , but the owner of the building gets a reward too , which is usually a lesser version of the building 's offering , but some offer in-game victory points . So you want to buy buildings and hope other players use them . If you use your own building , you do n't get the owner reward , just whatever anyone would get for using it . All the other spaces give money or one or two of a specific color cube ( `` adventurer for hire '' ) .You usually score in-game victory points by completing quests , of which there are five types : Warfare , Piety , Skullduggery , Commerce , and Arcana . Each requires a variety of colored cubes and/or money to complete , and the type of quest determines the bulk of the cubes and/or money it requires . White cubes are clerics ( Piety ) , Purple cubes are wizards ( Arcana ) , black cubes are thieves ( Skullduggery ) , and orange cubes are fighters ( warfare ) . Commerce quests all require money to complete in addition to a mix of cubes . Some quests offer an ongoing bonus power but are worth less ( these are called Plot Quests and clearly marked on the quest card ) . However , most just give you an immediate victory point bonus and/or some other cool thing , such as bonus cubes or money . One even gives you an extra , special colored meeple , but is worth no points and is a pain to complete . Get it early enough , and you can have a huge advantage . Get it or complete it late and not only will it not be of much help , but will likely cost you the game if you waste resources on it that could be better spent collecting other quests that hand out victory points.The game lasts eight rounds . Each round , all the spaces you can place your meeples on refresh with whatever goods they are offering ( money , buildings , intrigue cards , etc. ) . There is also a space for getting the first player token . There are always four face-up quests available , but if you do n't want any of those , you can choose to discard them all in favor of four new ones , but then you 're stuck with keeping one of whatever new ones come out . There is no penalty for uncompleted quests at the end of the game.My only real complaint is with the box itself . The way it is designed is arty-farty with a dumb extra `` fake '' bottom that ca n't be removed and exists just to look cool , so do n't put any weight on it , as that bends/crushes the box easily , which is not acceptable , especially for a game that costs this much . And , due to the stupid design of the bottom , you ca n't put the top lid over it . It wo n't fit . The plastic insert tray holds everything separate and mostly snug ( but way too snug in the case of the money and jewel tokens which are an absolute nightmare to put back in ) . As seemingly snug as things may appear , however , I would n't go turning the box upside-down if I were you . Also , after owning the game for a month , the inside bottom part of the box is split on two corners ! Do you know how many game boxes have done that to me ? Zero , at least in the time frame I 'm talking about here . Normally , it takes years , possibly decades , for a box to fall apart , but not this one . In my opinion , this is the worst-designed game box in board game history , and the plastic insert tray is no prize , either . All the other components ( cubes , cards , meeples , etc . ) are solid and durable , however.The newLords of Waterdeep Expansion : Scoundrels of Skullport ( D & D ; Boxed Game ) is due out August 20 , 2013 , and the rules are available to preview now as a free PDF on the Wizards of the Coast site . This double expansion contains two new add-on maps ( one for the evil underground town of Skullport , one for the infamous dungeon of Undermountain ) . There are a ton of new buildings , new quests , new intrigue cards , six new Lords ( including the beholder crime lord , Xanathar ) , a new resource called Corruption ( and an associated Corruption Track board ) , as well as optional rules , important rules clarifications and errata for the base game , and a set of gray meeples to add a sixth player . It also includes an extra meeple in each of the original player colors for longer games , which are mandatory when adding a sixth player and optional otherwise . So a two-player game would have you begin with five meeples , then add a sixth one on round five . This expansion -- the first of what will hopefully be many -- adds a ton of replayability and new ways to strategize and win . After reading the rules , it looks like a must-own.Note that a guy in Canada is selling custom , laser-cut , painted `` DnDeeples '' ( search for them using that term ) . For hardcore lovers of Lords , these can replace the cubes with meeple-looking clerics holding maces , dual-dagger wielding thieves , wizards with staff and pointy hat , and viking helmeted fighters with a sword !

While you can free-form build runs , I strongly think that you need a couple of examples for your child to follow for their first efforts so that they can become comfortable with the toy . I went to Quercetti 's web site hoping to find more examples , but all I found was a picture of a run , which I printed off and built.- It 's not very stable , and will collapse easily.- It 's difficult to do very much without the marble jumping off of the track . Part of the fun , I suppose , is experimenting to find just the right angles and speeds for the marbles , but the track does n't offer very fine control adjustments- The small , black connectors are hard to get apart , and the track connectors are somewhat flimsy.Overall , this is a good idea , but it falls short in reality . The manual is poor , the toy is n't as user friendly as it could be , and for my boy , it 's more frustrating than fun .

Yes , my kids enjoy it . However , it is so poorly put together that its just really , really annoying to play . The plastic pieces routinely fall over , or come off entirely . The person pictures come out quite easily unless you tape them in place , and if you tape them they may not flip properly . It takes maybe 30-60 seconds of `` set up '' time to play a 2-4 minute game . While this isnt the end of the world , I personally find it quite annoying.Here is how the game works : there are around 30 or 40 faces in the game . Each player randomly picks one card from the 40 . Each player has a rack which includes cards for all the faces which are turned away from the opposing player so that only you can see the faces in your rack . Each trait ( for example gender ) is split so that there is a minority ( i.e . there are only 6ish female faces , and 6ish black faces , etc ... ) and a majority ( the remaining faces -- i.e . 20+ are male , 20+ are white , etc ... ) . There are around 10 or so traits , all with this majority/minority trend -- gender , race , glasses , hats , bald , facial hair , etc ... Every person seems to have at least one or more minority traits ( i.e . its a man , but he is bald , or wearing a hat . ) You ask a question , ie `` is it a girl '' and , depending on the answer , flip over the boys/girls on your rack to eliminate them , and by process of elimination , and by asking more questions eg `` is the person bald '' work down till there is only one person on your rack , which must be the person the opposing player picked . Whoever gets down to one left on their rack first ( i.e . figures out who the other player picked first ) wins . Getting lucky and picking the right minority trait to ask about is more useful than good logic.I 'm not overly PC or anything , but I just cant warm to a game the whole purpose of which is asking questions designed to exclude people with minority traits , so you can , by process of elimination , figure out who is left.Moreover , the concept is so simple that I dont think the game is very educational . The kids ( even the very young ) quickly learn the basic concept . Once they learn it , there isnt any real learning left to do . ( Yes , its true an adult can use more advanced logic to pick the `` best '' questions , but good luck explaining that to a young kid .

Now , once I installed the battery ( 1 C battery ) and turned it on , the difficulty increased dramatically . The game spins fairly fast and the fish do n't have their mouths open for very long . Trying to hook one on a swinging fishing pole can become a little frustrating , even for me .

And because the fishing pole is two plastic pieces with a small cone/cup shaped plastic knob ( which is only a little smaller than the fish 's mouths ) instead of a magnet on a string as in the small , wind-up versions , catching fish is n't all that easy . It 's not terribly hard , as I got the hang of it in a few minutes , but it 's definitely not as easy as in the magnetic versions.Lastly , the reason some people have trouble putting the game back into its box is because some of the fish are still in their & # 34 ; up & # 34 ; positions ( sticking up , with their mouths open ) . You just need to rotate it manually until all fish are in their & # 34 ; down & # 34 ; positions .

Which would play tricks on the class every night , how the teacher read them this book , how the elf was their to watch over them , and sometimes cause trouble . So I went to the store and took one look at the doll and was creeped out . I 'm a man in his 30 's and I do n't scare easily but I thought the thing looked about as menacing as a christmas elf could ever look . So I said no thank you to spending 30 dollars to what I thought would guarantee my daughters nightmares . The wife and I compromised and bought the much sweeter looking Target special edition one that acts as a stuffed plush more than the one in the box and used it on christmas morning as if the elf helped leave clues to a scavenger hunt to where in the house to find the lego table `` santa '' brought . That thing was such a hit my daughter , she would sleep with it every night . As the next year came back around my daughter right away asked for the book , which we had avoided before . Reluctantly we took that journey and bought this book set . I think the price could be lower , but I must say a night has n't gone by since thanksgiving that she has n't read her little sitter the book . And since we are using the elf and moving it around secretly while the girls are sleeping , they run eagerly to seek for the elf every morning . Soon we will be mixing things up like using two tea pitchers to help swap the milk and orange juice in the others jug , thus blaming it on the elf . Half of the value of the book and doll is what you make out of it . I would never pay this much for a book you read once a year . But as an investment of an ongoing tradition I have less regretted the price . I was a little disappointed the girl elf lacked real difference than the boy . Considering we went to two stores to find the girl one . I could of saved the gas and settled with the boy elf and doubt they would tell any difference . I ca n't believe how much my daughters both eat this up . It 's like Santa got downsized and replaced by an elf . I can totally stand behind this product , if you have young kids . There was a time as a parent fresh out of college money was very tight and if this was 5 years ago I would be copping this by using a cheaper plush elf . So as a parent who has in my early year borrowed money to buy christmas for the kids I get how this can be pricey , but if you can afford this the reactions of the kids are magical and well worth it .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I bought this for my 4 y/o triplets .

I think there are some good reasons to add at least one or two HWK-290s to your Rebel fleet.To start on a slightly less positive note , the main thing to keep in mind is that this is a support ship designed to help other ships in your squad . So , while the base stats are less than ideal ( 1 attack dice , 2 defense dice , 4 hull , and 1 shields , plus the focus and target lock actions ) , they have some nice special abilities and upgrades that still make them worthwhile ( including a crew upgrade ) . Further , this is the first expanded universe ship that has been created for the game ( and while it is an interesting choice , it would not have been my first choice of expanded universe ships ... but , at least this really opens up the possibilities for future waves ) On a more positive note , is that it comes with 4 pilots ( including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities ) . Pilots include : ( 1 ) Rebel Operative , a level 2 non-unique pilot that costs 16 points . ( 2 ) Roark Garnet , a level 4 unique pilot that costs 19 points , who has a nice support special ability that reads , `` At the start of the combat phase choose 1 other friendly ship at Range 1-3 . Until the end of the phase , treat that pilot 's pilot skill value as 12 . '' Currently , the highest pilot skill is 9 ( or 11 if you use the Veteran Instincts elite pilot skill ) , so this effectively guarantees your ship will fire before anyone else . ( 3 ) Kyle Katarn , a level 6 unique pilot that costs 21 points , with another nice support special ability that reads , `` At the start of the Combat Phase , you may assign 1 of your focus tokens to another friendly ship at Range 1-3 . `` ( 4 ) Jan Ors , a level 8 unique pilot that costs 25 points , and yet another nice support special ability that reads , `` When another friendly ship at Range 1-3 is attacking , if you have no stress tokens , you may receive 1 stress token to allow that ship to roll 1 additional attack die . '' This can really help another ship offensively , potentially rolling five attack dice under the right circumstances ( this can be especially devastating if the attacking ship happens to have a focus and/or a target lock on the ship that is defending ) .Another nice thing it adds to the game are 6 upgrade cards ( several of which is exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released ) : ( 1 ) Ion Cannon Turret -- a 5 point upgrade that also came with the Y-Wing ; ( 2 ) Blaster Turret -- a new 4 point upgrade that can also be used on the Y-wing -- it allows you to spend a focus token to attack one ship at range 1-2 with three dice and a 360 degree firing ark ; ( 3 ) Saboteur -- a new 2 point crew upgrade card ( so it can also be used on the YT-1300 , Firespray-31 , or Lambda-Class Shuttle ) that gives you a 50/50 chance of turning a random face down damage card on an enemy ship face up ( i.e. , from a regular hit to a critical hit ) ; ( 4 ) Recon Specialist -- a 3 point crew upgrade ( ditto ) that lets you take two rather than one focus token when you perform a focus action ; ( 5 ) Intelligence Agent -- a 1 point upgrade that lets you look at an opposing ship 's maneuver dial at the start of the activation phase ; and ( 6 ) Moldy Crow -- a unique 3 point title upgrade that allows one HWK-290 ( only ) to keep unspent focus tokens from turn to turn.As with all expansions , this one includes all tokens , dials , etc . that you need to use this ship in a game ( though a copy of the base set is still needed to play ) .Overall , I think this ship adds some nice twists to an already fun game ( especially since so many of the upgrade cards can be used on other ships ) . I do not feel there is a need for an entire squad of them , but I did decide to buy two given the nice special abilities and upgrade cards it adds to the game .

We did have fun , but the two adults ( me and hubby ) found the shoddy construction particularly deplorable.Basically , the game parts consist of two plastic tubes with a plastic connector in between . These three parts are to be manually attached together and stood on the game base which is also made of plastic . The plastic color sticks are then to be inserted through the little holes in the tube connector in a crisscross pattern which will serve to hold the marbles ( which are provided in the box ) .The problems with this game are mainly due to the cheap plastic parts - they are so insubstantial and moving the canister ( for each player 's turn ) is cumbersome as a result and inadvertently jolts the marbles even further . Luckily , my 5-year-old was patient enough with the careful manipulation during each player 's turn , and we did have fun , but we found the overall experience to be underwhelming .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I ca n't seem to get the battery casing undone from under the truck unit .

Although it says 8+ , my 7 year old daughter also took to it right away and it has since become her favorite game.What I love about this game is it 's a quick and simple play and for anyone and everyone . The set up is easy , deal six cards to up to six players , everyone picks a color ( to represent them via Bunny on the score board and voting chips ) and you pick someone to start . They pick a card from their hand , for example let 's say Player 1 chooses a card with a Bunny on it and two doors before him , one red . This scene could remind the player of The Matrix ( one commonly used with this card among our group ) , Alice in Wonderland ( because of the white rabbit ) , Doors , Doorway or Entrance ( because of the doors , obviously ) or even Bunny or Rabbit ( for the younger players , there are more rabbits in different decks ) .Once he chooses his card , he says something that reminds him ( like the above mentioned ) , let 's say he chooses Alice in Wonderland as his phrase . The other players then pick a card from their hand , without revealing , that reminds them of Alice in Wonderland . Let 's say Player 2 has a card with a cat on it somewhere that reminds him of the Cheshire Cat , so he plays this . Player 3 has a card that shows several cards stacked , the top having a Red Queen on it , reminding him of the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland . So he plays this . Player 4 has nothing that represents the clue so he simply plays a card he wants to get rid of.Then all the cards are shuffled up so nobody knows who played what , then revealed on numbers 1-4 ( or however many characters are playing ) . Then each player looks at the cards and chooses which they think the first player played ( not nessasarily which they think is most like the clue , but which they think that player most likely played ) This game comes in handy when you play with people you know very well as you can anticipate what they chose sometimes based on their clues , their cards and who they are as a person . This makes the play funner sometimes and also challenges players to be more abstract with their clues.Each player votes anonymously , vote card face down , for which card they think PLayer 1 played . Once all votes are cast they are revealed.If everyone picked then right card , everyone but Player 1 gets 2 points ( penalizing Player 1 by being too obvious with their card or simply nobody else had a card that also represents the clue ) . Bunnies are moved up according to points.If at least one person voted for another card , then the players voting correctly AS WELL AS Player 1 all receive 3 points.The Player whose card was chosen also receives an extra point . They receive as many points as there are votes for their card , and those who wrongly chose their card receive none.If nobody chooses the correct card , everybody but Player 1 receives 2 points ( again penalizing Player 1 but this time for not being obvious enough ) . They also receive 1 point for everyone who votes for their card.The player who chooses a card this turn obviously does not vote as they already know the chosen card . You also may not vote on your own card at any time.It 's a very simple rule set up which goes quickly as points are quickly earned and everyone 's bunny races to the end.There is also a different set of gameplay for if you are playing with only 3 people , making it harder to narrow down the few cards by having opponets play two cards instead of one , providing 5 choices instead of 3 in a 3 player game.Definitley Highly Recommended , you 'll be buying expansion cards as soon as you fall in love with this game , too . I 've already purchased two myself . A must have for any gamer no matter what level or type of games you love , this truly is one for everyone .

I was very impressed with the quality of the paints . They spread very nicely , the colors remain intense after drying , they are very economical in the sense that a little goes a long way . I also used some of their glitter and their paint brushes , all of which worked great.HOWEVER.There is a non-profit online , safe cosmetics , that has produced a report about the safety of these paints . Please investigate on your own ! Snazaroo has responded on their website , but I remain a bit skeptical . They state 'hazardous materials are beyond classification limit ' . In the second statement Snazaroo just says it adheres to the 'current legislative limits ' for lead , nickel and cobalt.I say take the nastiness out completely : I do n't want it on my kid 's face .

At first I was worried she would fall over and hurt herself on these exposed poles . Next , the poles fell off , which then exposes this clear glue which my child wants to chew on.Just like the sorting cube I bought with this , the colored paint chips off . The square is 2 shapes which fit to be a square . Seems like a good advanced concept , but mostly concerned of the sharp edges . So those were put away.I should have bought one of the plastic versions of this . The paint would not have chipped off .

With that in mind , I try to judge products on their own merits , rating them highly if they are good and poorly if they are bad . However , if the product is not as a good as a common competitor , I just ca n't give it a full five stars . This is where I find myself in judging this Mudpuppy puzzle.My kids love puzzles . Our house is filled with all sorts of puzzles from 25 pieces to 2500 pieces . We just completedDragon Nursery 24 Piece Floor Puzzleand had a blast with it . In fact , it was sitting on the floor as we opened the Mudpuppy Puzzle . Perhaps this was unfair , but it is a fact of the puzzle market.To start with , the Mudpuppy puzzle is a quality toy . The pieces are thick and sturdy , with a glossy front and back that will make them resistant to drool and occasional food that may get on them . They fit together nicely and have bright , vibrant colors . The box has a nice carry handle made of rope , and the pieces fit in the box easily . We have a Melissa and Doug puzzle the kids like , but it is hard to get the pieces put back so that the box closes . That 's not a problem here - the box is plenty big for the pieces to be put back by a kid . The picture is nice - my 2 year old liked it , but my 5 year old thought it a little plain . He preferred his Ravensburger and Melissa and Doug puzzle artwork far more.And there 's the problem -- Mudpuppy puzzle quality is similar to M & D ; , but far below that of Ravensburger . The Ravensburger pieces are just such high quality , it is hard to compete . Plus , the Ravensburger puzzles cost less ! So my review ? It 's a great puzzle , quite possibly 5 stars . But with Ravensburger building better puzzles for less money , I have to knock it back to 4 , although my kids sure liked that rope handle on the box .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Beatiful and very fun fantasy adventure .
