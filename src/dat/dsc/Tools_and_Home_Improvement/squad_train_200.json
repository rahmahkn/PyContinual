So today I 'll be conducting a review on the 8OT ( my favorite knife by Schrade USA ) and give specific detail against the imported model by Taylor Cutlery ... Blade Steel : The original Old Timers used 1095 Carbon Steel and the Uncle Henry 's used Schrade 's Plus Steel ( 440A Stainless and 420HC in later years ) ... 1095 was a great blade steel you could get for a slipjoint but it was also the standard steel offering of American knife brands . This steel yielded between 0.90-1.03 % in carbon content and was just about holding a really good edge and being easy to sharpen . The only thing about 1095 you had to get used to was that cutting fruit or cleaning small game or anything moist the steel would tarnish/form a patina.For people used to the patina effect from carbon steel it gave an antiquated arts & crafts appeal to the knife , for people who liked their blades pretty they hated it.Great edge life you 'd get from 1095 Carbon Steel but it was n't for people who neglected oiling their blades or leaving water or chemicals on them for extended period of time . So the newer Schrade 's by Taylor Cutlery do n't use carbon steel they are now stainless and not even the quality of Plus Steel.This steel is not 440C as that is a super stainless and China does n't use 420/440 Series stainless steels they develop their own . The steel holds an alright edge but it 's dense and not soft like actual 440A , it just does n't sharpen worth a lick on a stone ... that 's because China has purity issues with making their own steels , not every China made knife is like this but from Taylor they scrape the bottom of the barrel . The transition to stainless steel might have made some happy but regardless 1095 Carbon definitely made an Old Timer what it is.Was Schrade USA 's Plus Steel bad in comparison ? Not exactly I 've got a few blades in Schrade USA 's Plus Steel and their stainless steel did hold a good edge.Those older knife manufacturers like Imperial Knives USA and Camillus were known for hardening all their blades from 57-59rc ... good heat treatments back then were n't a selling factor if everyone did really good work . But a lot of people did n't get that stainless steels were soft and heat treated for strength/performance and offered rust resistance with less carbon while 1095 was a tool steel.1095 is a very pure steel so a heat treatment has a more intense effect on the steel making it noticeably harder than a stainless . Purity is why 1095 sharpens up faster and brings back a edge that has more definition to it ... in short it comes back sharper . The carbon of course is for long edge life but that hard edge from 1095 also makes it well known for holding it 's edge to coarse materials as a cutlery steel . As I said before Schrade USA 's Plus Steel holds it 's edge and was made to perform so it is underrated . I grew up on carbon steel and it 's much longer lasting and better in too many ways to overlook as a user steel.Edge : The original Schrade USA 8OT Stockman did n't possess quite a sweet edge like a Camillus but out of the blister pack they were useable . The imported version does have a improved grind on the blade so it looks sharper but it 's a fat wedge like cutting edge versus the keen edge formed from the original 's flat grind ... in short the imported model ca n't carve wood worth a darn because of that blunt edge it has.Sheepsfoot and Spey Blade : These two blades face each other now so they do n't take up more than a single backspring 's worth of space and that 's because they drastically thinned out these two blades . The blades are n't useless now but they are n't reliable like the thick blades of the original 8OT ... you can bend these blades.Blade Snap : The imported version of the Schrade 8OT does have better blade snap over the original , Schrade USA 's ranged from fair to good when it came to blade snap . This might be irrelevant to someone but if you did n't like oiling your carbon steel backsprings they are now stainless steel.Delrin Scales : The Schrade USA originals had dark and light brown delrin scales while the imported version shoots for black and tan instead.The hacksaw grooves I 'll give China credit the texturing feels a little deeper than the originals . Did n't like the use of black for the delrin because it obviously spilled over from the mold into the tan and it looks grey.Schrade USA had a tendency to do the same but the use of two different shades of the same color contrasted well.Final Thoughts : There are comparisons between the original Schrade USA 8OT Stockman and the imported model to make , but the bottom of the truth is the original Old Timer 8OT was a better knife . Schrade USA was simply a machine-made user knife brand that cost less minus the trimmings found on pricier slipjoints like swedgeworked clip-points , longer matchstick nail-nicks , four brass liners instead of three and sweeter edge work.But you 'd get something as reliable as any other knife with the same steel as other brands . Not surprised Schrade USA fell through , you ca n't sign paychecks if you have a handful of customers that buy slipjoints when the majority goes for one-handed blade access . If you 've never had an original Schrade/Old Timer USA 8OT you might like this knife but it really does n't follow the reputation that original had in any way simply because it 's not the same knife .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Mixes paint OK , but takes a lot of work moving up and down , side to side to mix in gallon containers , because these are so small .

When sanding , you can simply glide the sander back and forth , without having to push down at all . Porter-Cable came up with a design that gives you a lot of power , but at the same time control over that power . This is what a belt sander SHOULD be like.The position of the front handle makes sense -- it is up higher than the front of the machine , so you get a good position relative to the sanding surface . The handle is also designed to give you a lot to grab onto.The dust bag is designed well . You can swivel it in any direction to get it out of the way while you 're sanding , and it holds the dust without spilling until you 're ready to empty it out . Also , it does a fair job collecting the dust , but you should never expect any dust-bag system to be perfect.The meachinism for loading and unloading sander belts is very good . It is easy to place the belt in the sander and then tighten it up securely.The tracking system really holds the sander belt in place . I placed the belt on the sander , held it upside-down , running the sander until the belt no longer shifted left or right . Then I began sanding , and for the whole time I worked , the belt did not move from center at all . Because the housing is made of metal , even if the belt DID move , it would not damage the sander , as it would on machines with plastic bodies.All told , this sander is a great combination of power and ease of use.PS : The 3X21 sander belts that Porter-Cable makes ( the purple ones ) are excellent .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I bought this about a year ago , still having great results .

Dewalt did this one right.It 's built well , works well , and it 's priced right . What more do you need ? Setting the depth is foolproof , and the depth stays consistent.I use it more often for cement backerboard with durock screws than I do drywall . But for either job , I 'm totally happy with its performance.If you 're a homeowner/occassional user , the price puts this in the realm of serious consideration . If you 've got three or four sheets of drywall to put up , you do n't need it.If you think you 'll do more than one project in your lifetime though , spend the 90 bucks . It 's SO MUCH faster than the cordless drill approach . And you wo n't over/under drive your screws ( assuming you set the depth correctly to begin with , of course ) .One word of warning to the casual user - Remember that this is a professional level tool . The instructions assume you 're a pro . You wo n't just pick this thing up and start using it like a pro.Expect to have to practice a little with it first , until you get the technique down . You typically run this thing all out at top speed without letting up on the trigger between screws . Most people have trouble until they figure that out.It 's not a regular drill where you have to slowly bring the screw up to speed . With drywall guns , the bit does n't turn till you push the screw to the wall , when it catches it drives the screw at top speed , then stops turning once it hits the right depth . It all happens in the blink of an eye.You ca n't be overly careful with the thing , you have to put a screw on and jam it in with one quick decisive motion . Being timid with it only gets crooked screws driven half way.I 'd recommend using the shortest screws you can get by with until you get profficient with it.So there 's a bit of an art to it ( and this applies to all drywall guns , not just this one ) . But nothing you should n't be able to pick up very quickly.There are other good ones out there , but nothing I 'd recommend over this one.And if you 're thinking cordless - do n't do it . Cordless tools have their place , but this is n't one of them . As mentioned above , you want to keep this thing pegged as you 're popping screws in . Having a power cord attached to you is a very small price to pay for never having to worry about a constantly diminishing battery charge . ( oh and only 4 stars because the instructions really are kind of useless , and I think they should include a case with some extra bits - they have to box the thing anyways , how much more would a blow molded case cost them instead ? 50 cents ? ...

The kerf of the blade is thinner than full , so it will flex some and there is no room for a stiffener on the DeWalt miter box due to the short arbor . I used a caliper to measure my DW3128 and the teeth are .096 '' wide and the blades body is .074 '' . This is in contrast with a real full kerf blade with 1/8 '' wide teeth and a body that is ~.088 '' .3 . I 'm not sure why , probably to save on cost , but DeWalt does n't appear to finely grind the sides of the carbide teeth compared to other more expensive blades.4 . You really can and will notice a difference between these and a good quality Freud industrial blade . After only installing 1000 SQFT of oak flooring , my blade is crap.5 . The technology of these blades are very poor , there is minimal vibration dampening using only an old technology of slots versus the wiggly cut lines a good blade has.6 . My miters were never perfectly tight until I ditched this blade and bought the one linked below . Yes , the blade does cut OK miters that are plenty good for a normal person , but if you want the most professional looking cuts , do n't skimp on the blade ! I recommend the Freud LU80R012 blade if you are doing finish work and want professional results ( and a blade that has much more carbide , e.g . can be sharpened many more times ) . I did a lot of research and finally decided on the Freud LU80R012 blade as it can cut Melamine and plywood very well , but still has Freud 's best rating for cross cuts . The hook angle is also smaller than the Freud LU85R012 and the kerf slightly larger , so it 's much better for use in a miter box.I 'm no longer sure one needs a thinner kerf blade for a miter box due to it only doing cross cuts . That 's why I 'm recommending the full kerf LU85R012 . My DeWalt sliding miter box with the full kerf blade seems plenty powerful.Here 's what I 'm replaced this blade with : Freud LU80R012 Ultimate Plywood & Melamine Saw Blade 12 inch x 96t Hi-ATB 1 inch arbor Perma-Shield CoatedIf you are in doubt about the quality difference and my review , just zoom in the pictures !

In a VERY short time , however , you 'll master the technique , and the results are spectacular.I made some checkerboards where the dark wood was 1/16 '' higher than the light wood . This would have meant a lot of sanding with the random orbit sander . It 's the kind of task you always see the drum sanders doing in their advertisements . The 362VS can take one of those boards down to dead flat in about 1 minute . It is amazing ... not just the speed of the task , but the quality of the product.Here 's an opinion and some advice ... If you 've wanted a belt sander for belt-sanding tasks , this is the one to get . If you 've been eyeing those drum sanders that cost more than twice what the 362VS costs , you might want to consider the 362VS as a great alternative that can do not only the same task as a drum sander , but is also much more versatile and consumes very little space in the ol ' shop.Do n't cut corners , however .

The blower force can be turned up and down , and is powerful.I cut a 5ft diameter circle table from fur-wood flooring in a single circular cut today . The blade did n't eject and it was n't crooked . And thanks to the blower I did n't have to stop a single time , it was a single cut.You can rotate the base on a horizontal pivot like a circular saw , and you can increase the orbital action of the blade for a more aggressive cut in thinner materials.Bits can be changed with a spring action lever right above the blade , which can be done even with gloves on ( but unplug the tool first ) .All of these features have worked flawlessly for me in both light duty and heavy duty applications .
