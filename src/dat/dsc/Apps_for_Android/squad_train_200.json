Hexage is known for stunning visuals and innovative game-play twists on strategy genres , and they do not disappoint on this title . I also feel that this game has not received enough credit on its Amazon port , as very few people know about it . In an attempt to give an accurate and easy to view review , here are the pros and cons of the puzzle game `` Totemo HD '' : Pros -*Great Visuals - The graphics in `` Totemo HD '' are what puts this puzzle game over the top for me . On the Kindle Fire HD , the visuals are breathtaking due to its usage of the High Definition version . The background visuals , the menu screens , and the spirits themselves bring an eerie feeling to this puzzle game . I would say that these visuals bring a feel reminiscent of the zen puzzle game `` Quell '' . Your `` guide '' and narrator of the game ( the totem man ; traveling between worlds ) is very vibrant and again adds to the ghastly feel of the game . *Easy Controls ; Difficult Game - `` Totemo HD '' paces the game well as you begin to play it by matching the `` spirits '' in pairs of various numbers ( 2 , 3 , ect . ) in vertical or horizontal lines . It may seem simple , but the addition of other barricades such as star spirits add to the complexity . Some levels are insanely hard and challenging , which I feel is much better than hundreds of easy levels . The 100 levels in this game will keep you going for a while , and the challenge makes it worthwhile in comparison to some puzzle games that are just too easy for a majority of the time . *Great Accompaniment Soundtrack - The Kindle Fire HD 's Dolby Digital Plus sound system seems to make great use of Hexage 's soundtrack in their games , and the eerie sounds of `` Totemo HD '' add to the general feel of the game . With the visuals and music , it creates a wonderfully surreal puzzle playing atmosphere . *Survival Mode - On top of the 100 levels of puzzles , a survival mode pressures you to complete endless amounts of puzzles quickly to keep going , and an online leader board makes this even more enjoyable.Cons -*HD Only ( ? ) - As I have a Kindle Fire HD , I have no problem with paying $ 1.99 to get a stunning HD puzzle game , but I think this may be a negative aspect for regular Kindle Fire users as `` Totemo HD '' is the only version of the game in the Amazon App store . Regular Kindle Fire users will not be able to use the HD aspect of this game , sadly , and I would suggest if possible , Hexage , to put a regular port of the game on the marketplace . *Possibly Short - `` Totemo HD '' currently has 100 levels . I have heard that it previously had only 62 , and I am glad that Hexage expounded on the number of levels . To many , this seems to be too few levels , but the difficulty of them ( starting VERY early on ) makes it longer than one may expect . Even so , I ca n't imagine this game taking too long for people to beat , but I would recommend playing survival mode or the story again . *No hints - There is no hint system or `` pay-to-proceed '' system using either real money or in game currency ( as there is no in game currency ) . This may turn some people off , since the levels are difficult . For me , this was n't a problem.Conclusion - '' Totemo HD '' is a puzzle game that is hard to pass up . It 's challenging , beautiful , and the soundtrack is great for doing these puzzles . I highly recommend this game , and I feel it has gotten far to little recognition on the Amazon Appstore . Check this game out , even if you are only a casual puzzle gamer .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Can someone tell me why you would download this ? what a waste of time..thought is was another movie site to use", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I use this one every day to check on the major stories in British newspapers .

I stripped it off my tablet after 2 days because I grew tired of having to shut it down whenever I turned on my device ... and wanted to use it for something else ( and I have about the fastest processor available now on mobile devices ) , and a lot of ram . It is not a problem unless I am running another program which needs a lot of memory , but why have a memory hog running in the background ? This service is not that much more convenient then others , not enough to where I think it is worth the amount of ( disk ) space it demands , or the memory load . Add to that what is effectively spyware ( why would it be running in the background if it is not monitoring & reporting as you agreed to allow when you installed it ) . Personally I do not think the package is worth what it costs in terms of system lag ... but that is a personal thing . If you do a lot of uploading and this service is your primary means of sharing pictures then it could be worth it to you .
