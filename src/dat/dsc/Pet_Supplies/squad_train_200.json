You should get the ones that fit how much you dog drips so it may take some experimenting my dog was large so mine were the most absorbent I could get . Great thing is you can get them in-store and on sale almost anywhere ! I bought baby wipes to wipe him down and keep him clean , remember it is the same concept as a baby wearing a diaper and sitting in it , I did n't want to risk any infection . No alcohol ! Make sure you measure your dog , to tight can cause a lot of chafing ! ! Mine was the right size but I ended up sewing micro-fiber cloth on the elastic part where the material scrunched up as this was causing chafing behind his manly area . He was not use to anything rubbing his skin in that area and the material is pretty stiff . I had to leave it off till it healed and sadly I never had the chance to see if the microfiber would have relieved the problem . Make sure you check your dog to make sure this is not occurring due to some dogs have a higher tolerance to pain . It would be great if they could use a softer material in the elastic area .

Eventually I got a new Yorkie , a spunky spindly thing , that loves to eat but hates eating dog food . I tried different formulas of different brands , some expensive , some cheap , but mostly stayed with Purina One with the extra meat bits because my Yorkie and my Chiweenie enjoyed the meaty bits . However , once the meaty bits were gone , the dry kibble stayed forever and they would graze on it from time to time . For little dogs , this meant they were constantly needing to go poop.Enter Pro Plan . I picked this dog food up on a whim since I was already in a pet store . Both my dogs fell in love with the dog food immediately . They would eat their portion in one sitting . ( Mosty , the Chiweenie would leave a small amount behind to snack on later . ) My Yorkie , my picky eater , cleaned out his bowl - crumbs and all.What happened next surprised me.My spindly , springy-legged Yorkie filled out . I 've been trying to get this dog to gain weight since he was a adult puppy . Nothing I fed him , from cheap to expensive , ever made him gain weight . I figured finally it was his natural genetics . He was n't sickly or lacked energy , he just was a skinny dog . However , since he 's been eating Pro Plan Focus Toy Breed Formula , he eats his full portion and he 's filled out nicely so he 's not so spindly anymore.Another thing I notice is that my Yorkie would vomit at least twice a week . This has completely stopped.As for my Chiweenie ( a Chihuahua/Dachshund mix ) , who is built more like a Chihuahua style tank ; I was concerned that she would grow fat with Pro Plan . Nope . Not at all . She 's has stayed fit and trim.Another benefit : With them eating on a controlled schedule , I 've been better able to manage their potty habits and have eliminated nearly all potty accidents inside the house .

I got litter all over the floor when I was tipping it into the garbage sack , bits stick in the mesh and some fall out unexpectedly , and then you have to pour the remaining ( dirty ) litter into the other pan to get it on top of the mesh again - which releases dust , smells disgusting and just is n't a clever thing to do .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "So last night I experienced a litter emergency ( emptied out the box only to realize I barely had any left to refill ) and the only store still open was Target . So I wanted to switch from Tidy Cats which I found to be too dusty and has this weird deoderizer smell which progressively becomes less pleasant the longer it stays out . Having a limited variety to choose from , I picked up World 's Best . BIG mistake . Honestly , it 's not as though I was expecting this to be the best , but ironically it 's probably among the worst . I understand all the hype about all natural products , but using corn as litter is probably the dumbest idea . When I opened the bag , I did n't expect that it it would smell exactly like grain . I wondered how something that smelled like that could possibly neutralize urine and feces odors , but since this product is priced higher than the rest and is obviously selling , I decided to ignore my skepticism . It has not even been 24 hours since I purchased this and I am absolutely outraged that this company has the nerve to sell an 8 lb bag for close to $ 10 and claim to be the world 's best litter , when their product is complete trash.Here 's everything that is wrong with this litter : -It smells like grain out of the bag and just smelled like grain mixed with feces and urine after my cat used it . I do n't know how this has any positive reviews , but I noticed that some positive ones express that those who have issues with it probably have cats with very stinky excrement . Well , my cat is a tiny kitten whose poop is NOT overly stinky because she is fed the best quality food I can find . I just dumped all the litter into the trash , because seeing how it smells , I know my cat will stop using the box if it stays in there any longer . Cats are like that.-Many people expressed that this litter breaks down into a fine powder after some time . I already noticed that powder forming along the bottom of the box . This means DUST , which I 'm guessing is the reason she had stopped burying her waste with the Tidy Cats . Plus she was sneezing all the time . That being said , in terms of odor , Tidy Cats is still a far better product and less expensive than this one.-This is perhaps the WORST part : When I placed my cat into the litter box after adding this litter to introduce her to it , she sniffed for a couple of minutes and I was horrified when she ATE a few grains . She was confused and thought it was FOOD ! I can imagine how ludicrous it must have seemed to her to have to poop and pee in food . After I read another review about someone else 's cat eating it , I gave up on the idea of using it up by mixing it with the new litter I bought ( Precious Cat which sells a much higher rated 18 lb bag for almost the same price this one sells an 8 lb bag for ) .That being said , if I ca n't stand the smell of this litter , I 'm fairly certain my cat ca n't . The main reason cats stop using their litter boxes is because of odor issues . I pay extra for odor control and if , after cleaning the box twice a day as I usually do , I still have to deal with odor issues , then this stuff is clearly a huge waste of money . So far I ca n't say much about the Precious Cat , which I immediately went out and purchased to replace this one , other than the fact that when I opened the bag , I did n't smell any funny odor or experience a puff of dust , and when I put my cat into the box she sniffed a bit and walked out as though there was nothing unusual worth investigating . If you can get to a Pet Supplies Plus or Petco , I 'd probably buy that one as it 's only a bit more expensive than Tidy Cats and probably WAY better ( I 'll soon find out ) .

Buy them a COVERED playpen , or leave them in their chinchilla-appropriate cages . They have fun wherever they are . Chichillas really do n't care where they are , as long as they have walls to bounce off of and wooden toys to destroy . Anyone who has done ANY research into the temperature control needed by chinchillas to survive ( hello- they wear a fur coat all year . Their fur is made up of approx . 80 strands of hair per hair follicle . That 's a really thick fur coat to be wearing all day , all year round . ) would realize that furry little critters enclosed in a plastic ball with very small slits for air equals an animal that is going to overheat if left in there for more than 10 minutes . Speaking of the slits in the ball ; they are the PERFECT size for itty bitty cute little chinchilla toes to get caught and SMASHED in . Let us not forget , ( yeah I 'm talking to the person who said this was mess free playtime ) that while your little guy is running around , getting all nice and overheated , risking his toes being ripped off with every step , that CHINCHILLAS POOP CONSTANTLY . They like to pee quite a bit , too . So while all of this is going on , your chinchilla is now also running in his own feces and urine . What goes up.. must come down.. Being in an enclosed ball with the feces and urine while the ball is in motion puts aforementioned waste into your chinchillas fur , and possibly even their eyes and nasal cavity .

These units are generally reliable . The biggest benefit is the odor control . The dirty stuff is raked into a plastic catch-bin that has a lid . The smell is kept to a minimum , until the catch-bin is too full and the lid does n't close fully.My first LitterMaid 's retractable power cord ( on the rake ) stopped recoiling into the unit , so it eventually got snagged on the rake , and it broke . That was after more than 3 years of use . Not bad for a product that runs at least 10-15 times a day ( I 've got 2 cats ) . My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter . I 've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand . Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess . The next thing is to keep the litter level below the `` max fill '' line . Too much litter causes the rake to bog down . Also , cooking oil spray ( pam ) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.I use the `` disposable '' catch pans over and over until they crack . I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out . I ca n't imagine tossing it out after one filling . That 's a big expense , and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item . I do n't use a liner/bag in the catch . Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash . I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days . Normally , I just dump the bin , use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake , and that 's it . I have gone well over 6 months before doing any major cleaning of the box.If you have more than one cat , I would get the `` Mega '' model , since it is bigger . The new Advanced model is n't getting good reviews here at Amazon , so I would keep away from that unit.The LitterMaids are a bit noisy . That maybe the biggest drawback . Also , it is not a perfect cleaner , and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days . There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan , and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off ( this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line ) . It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks , but once you do , you will love it.I will always own a LitterMaid because it keeps the house smelling like we do n't have cats .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I bought this for my kitten ( now a cat ) and he loves it .

The piller is very sturdy , and the hard plastic tube on the outside allows cats to chew or bite itwithout ruining it , or catching your fingers . The plunger is also sturdy . I have two now , because Ihave one for each cat . That is n't probably necessary , but I like to do it that way.Be sure to put the piller in the RIGHT SIDE of the cat 's mouth - you have a less chance of the pillgoing down the windpipe that way . Also , please be sure to give your cat some food or a treat after the pillto be sure it goes all the way to the tummy .
