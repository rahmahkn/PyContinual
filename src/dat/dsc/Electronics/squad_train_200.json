So I tried several other mice , and finally switched to a Logitech trackball ( Trackman Wheel Optical ) and that helped to reduce some of the stiffness and pain I was feeling , but it did not eliminate it . Plus , the vein just to the left of my thumb has enlarged significantly , probably due to all the thumb movement from moving the trackball around . So , I once again went looking for alternatives.I had been waiting to get one of these Kensington trackballs for awhile , but their software ( Mouseworks ) was not fully compatible with Vista or Win7 64-bit . So when I heard that they had released new software ( Trackballworks ) for 64-bit , I went ahead and pulled the trigger . I had a chance to try out both Mouseworks and Trackball works , and am sad to report that , although the Trackball works supports customizing all buttons ( as of May/June 2010 ) , it 's not quite as feature-rich as the older Mouseworks software . ( For example , you can no longer customize the buttons on a per-app basis , though they may add this capability back in at a future date . ) However , for those who know what AutoHotkey is , this is n't a huge problem , but does require you to get your hands a bit dirty with some scripting.But the real question is , how does it feel ? The ball comes out spinning kind of rough out of the box , but if you 've read many reviews of this trackball , you 'll know that the 'oils ' on your fingers will smooth it out pretty quickly , and that 's what happened with mine . However , I found the unit to be too big , as my hand has to do gymnastics to be able to use the ball and hit all the buttons , and it basically transferred the pain from my hand to my wrist . ( Trying with and without the included wrist rest did n't make much difference . ) I tried changing which buttons did what , but it did n't really help . Plus , it was taking me twice as long as with my Logitech trackball to do complex operations , such as selecting text while using the scroll ring to scroll the page . And trying to speed things up would put too much strain on my hand.However , other folks would tell you that this trackball ( and it 's cousin , the Slimblade ) is like the second coming , thus it 's really hard to gauge how the unit will fit in your hand , because hands come in different sizes , and these things are very subjective . ( My hands are of average size for a male ) . What feels great to one person will be very uncomfortable to another . The best advice I can give you is to try to find one locally and see how it feels in your hand . Barring that , I suppose you could always order one and return it if it does n't feel 'right ' to you.In the meantime , I am going back to my Logitech trackball , and maybe find another mouse or trackball that I can switch out every few hours .

Controls are reasonably well laid-out and fairly easy to handle , even for middle-aged hands and thick fingers like mine.For the record , this is my first digital camera . I regard myself as an & quot ; intermediate & quot ; amateur in 35mm film photography , and desktop computer operations.Though I have not yet made any prints from the digital images I have taken with this camera , I am very well satisfied with the color and sharpness in the daylight macro images taken in my rose garden as I view them on my iMac . The attempt to photograph my nephews ' graduation from the bleachers of a high school gymnasium , however , revealed the limitations of the modest built-in flash , and the lens ' ability to pick up & quot ; ghosts & quot ; of the overhead lighting.The camera can take pictures in your choice of three quality levels ( basic , normal , or fine ) and one of two pixel sizes ( 640x480 or 1280x960 ) . A 320x240 file size can accomplished by editing a recorded image using the & quot ; resize & quot ; function . Indeed , any larger size can be reduced to a smaller size ( to the minimum 320x240 ) . This can save space on the SmartMedia card , or reduce transmission time over internet email , for instance.The camera comes with one 4MB SmartMedia card . According to the owners manual , the & quot ; standard & quot ; number of 1280x960 images which can be recorded in 4MB ranges from 6 & quot ; fine & quot ; to 12 & quot ; normal & quot ; to 23 & quot ; basic ; & quot ; and the number of 640x480 images ranges from 23 & quot ; fine & quot ; to 44 & quot ; normal & quot ; to 69 & quot ; basic & quot ; . The manual goes on to say that actual capacity & quot ; varies slightly depending on the type of subject. & quot ; The highly recommended purchase of a 32MB card increases 1280x960 & quot ; standard & quot ; capacity to 50 & quot ; fine , & quot ; 99 & quot ; normal , & quot ; and 180 & quot ; basic & quot ; images ; and 640x480 & quot ; standard & quot ; capacity to 180 & quot ; fine , & quot ; 330 & quot ; normal , & quot ; and 496 & quot ; basic & quot ; images.An indoor flash picture of a furnished room revealed some barely detectable & quot ; jaggies & quot ; along the edges of a lamp shade in the & quot ; normal & quot ; mode . Switching to & quot ; fine & quot ; eliminated these altogether . ( BTW , in a normal-size room , the flash exposure was ample . ) I must agree with the many reviewers who have written that the LCD display is a bit too small and not bright enough to see easily in full sunlight , but I have found that a & quot ; banker 's visor & quot ; or & quot ; big bubba & quot ; billed cap can help.The optical viewfinder is another solution , and is especially useful because it actually & quot ; zooms & quot ; along with the lens in pseudo-SLR fashion . But unlike a true thru-the-lens viewer , the parallax error in this camera is significant . Because the & quot ; film & quot ; does not & quot ; see & quot ; exactly the same & quot ; frame & quot ; as the optical viewfinder , you might end up cutting off Aunt Mildred 's head in that next photo if you do n't take care.The camera manuals , though they still sound a bit & quot ; translated , & quot ; are actually very informative , well organized , and well thought-out . The installation of the software drivers , and downloading over the USB interface to my iMac with MacOS 8.6 went without a hitch.Besides a larger SmartMedia card , other recommendable additions include one ( or better yet , two ) full sets of rechargeable batteries with recharger . And , if you plan to spend time using the in-camera editing features , consider getting the AC adapter , too.Playback functions include a nice nine-image LCD & quot ; thumbnail & quot ; display mode . And those with advanced interests might want to take advantage of the camera 's ability to edit various Digital Print Order Format ( DPOF ) settings.My verdict on the Fujifilm FinePix 1400 Zoom is that it is a very good value as an entry-level digital camera capable ( within reasonable limits ) of capturing excellent images for computer viewing .

Also sent to them was the professional repair diagnosis and repair estimate ( $ 1,500 parts alone ) , the power supply was dead as well as the main circuit board . This was also proof the damage occurred through the outlet and not some magical event . Belkin ran their tests and simulated *minor* surges and found no issues and therefore were not liable . They even sent back the exact protector so I could continue to use it ... very thoughtful ... Long story short , do n't *ever* expect to make a claim with Belkin and receive compensation for a failure to protect your equipment .

With a color display and a price tag under $ 200 , it seemed to have it all . It does delivery nicely on all of that promise . Unfortunately , Palm handicapped the E with one inexplicable design flaw that outweighs all of its upside - they somehow failed to include the ironically-named `` universal connector '' for recharging and syncing the unit . Instead , it comes with two separate jacks on its underside : one mini-USB for data sync and one AC adapter plug , leaving you faced with an unnecessary clutter of cords crossing your desk.In the beginning , I wanted to give the E every chance I could based on its functionality , and so I was lenient on this design oddity . Still , the inconvenience eventually made me hate using it . The plug design basically forces you into a choice between two very imperfect options - ( a ) threading the cords to the front of your desktop somehow so that you can have it right-side-up and still use it while plugged in , or ( b ) putting the cords behind the desk where they belong with the others and then suffering with an upside-down Palm . With option ( a ) , the relatively short cords and large jacks also put the unit at high risk of being knocked or dragged off of the desk . With option ( b ) , even syncing became a chore - the lack of a cradle button to trigger a sync means that you have to power up the unit and kick it off via on-screen icons , all while looking at it upside-down or else yanking a bunch of messy excess cord onto your desk.Still , I wanted to make the most of the E 's robust bundle of applications , and for its low price , I knew not to expect that everything would come standard in the box . So I went shopping for a proper charging cradle , only to find that no such accessory for the E exists . In fact , Palm does n't even sell replacements for its individual sync/charging cables at all . So , aside from all routine inconvenience while using it , this model also comes with the incredible risk that if either cord is every lost or damaged , you become the proud owner of a sleek-looking $ 200 paperweight . It 's possible by now that some third-party company has begun creating unlicensed cords that claim to be compatible , but that 's hardly comforting in the face of Palm 's obvious lack of support for its own product line.And given the weak battery that the E is equipped with ( and it ca n't be upgraded ) , you 'll have it connected to the charging cord quite a bit . When I was using it religiously every workday , I needed to recharge it each night . What a disappointment this setup is compared to , for example , the Tungsten T3 - it uses the universal connector to dock with a cradle that continuously charges it and syncs it on command while keeping it at an ideal ergonomic angle for use/reference while sitting on your desktop . And since its using the universal connector , you 're able to accessorize it further , i.e . buy a separate docking cradle for the office , a charger for the road , etc . The T3 setup makes perfect sense , the E setup is shamefully inadequate - it 's as if Palm wants E owners to never forget that they purchased `` the cheap one '' .In conclusion , its advertised plusses are very real , but go for the Tungsten E at your own risk . Its greatest failure is that there is no obvious reason why it could n't have lived up to its potential as the ultimate PDA . The more you live with its one Achilles ' Heel , the more you 'll wish you 'd spent a little extra on the T3.PROSVersatility and quality of applications that it runs ( MS Office , Acrobat , MP3 , photos , movies , etc . ) Brilliant color displayCONSLack of universal connector makes everyday use/charging/syncing more and more irritatingLack of Palm support for the E , as in no replacement cords available , makes it a risky option", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I bought this for my 2012 Wrangler and it does not fit the antenna or stereo .

If you can , go with a PCI adapter for much better performance.When I recently rebuilt my primary workstation I found to my chagrin that my existing Linksys Wireless-G WMP54G PCI NIC would not work in my new AOpen A4C Max motherboard . Try as I might ( a few BIOS upgrades and disabling the card ) I could not get it to work , due to the integration of the Broadcom Gigabit PCI LAN Chip into the board . Enter the `` Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G . `` The Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz , and supports the following wireless protocols : 802.11b and 802.11g . The Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G can transmit and receive networking traffic in a range of 1 - 54Mbps . I choose the Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' for three reasons ; 1 . The card operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz the same frequency band I currently use for my wireless communications ; 2 . The Linksys name is one I have come to trust for reliability and cutting edge technology ; 3 . The Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' is USB version . 2.0 compliant.Installation : The installation of the Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' is a very straight forward process : just plug it in -- with the computer on -- and it starts working ! My Microsoft Windows XP Professional Operating System ( OS ) found it and installed the necessary drivers , and made it ready for use . There is no software to install ; thought Linksys does provide a utility to configure the card to work with your wireless setup , which I admit a non Windows XP user might need . However , Windows XP Professional is designed -- once a wireless device is installed -- to seek out available wireless networks and configure the card accordingly ; i.e . assign it an IP address , if DHCP ( Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ) is used on the network . I use DHCP on my combined wired and wireless network , but I assigned the Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' an IP address because my computer serves as my Internet gateway.If you do decide to install the software , good luck . Like a lot of Linksys software utilities of late -- even those downloaded directly from the Linksys website -- the software refuses to load ; e.g . the autostart start , and then stops abruptly . So I opened Windows Explorer , browsed to the CD and double-clicked on the setup.exe under the Utility directory ; no dice . Only a token portion of the software loaded , enough of a token to keep render the card useless . So I uninstalled the software and left it uninstall ; as I pointed out above if you are using the Windows XP OS there will be no need for the software that ships with the card . Will it install under Windows 98/Me/Se/2000 ? , Perhaps , but no longer owing a computer with any of those OS 's installed , I can not credibility speak to it.First ImpressionsI have mixed feelings about the `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' Linksys surprisingly dropped the ball in the design of this card . While the `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' occasionally transmits and receives at 54Mbps , the speed of the card fluctuates on a continual basis reaching as low as 1MBps , several times a minute ! I have placed the card is various locations around my loft not more than 75 feet from the Wireless Access Point ( WAP ) , but still the fluctuating carrier speed continues to my frustration . And while the antenna is small , it is larger than the one on the Linksys `` Wireless-G WPC54G CardBus Adapter '' installed in my notebook , which manages to maintains a consistent carrier speed of 54Mbps.This annoying pervasive fluctuating carrier speed has affected at times the speed at which I access the Internet and move file to and from my workstation and the rest of the network . Linksys offers no advice on how to fix this problem other then the usual `` move the adapter around and adjust the antenna '' pronouncements , which do little to fix the problem . My advice : do n't but this card unless your computer will not support a PCI NIC.ConclusionThe `` Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G '' receives a C+ from me . While I give the card high marks for ease of installation and configuration -- thanks in part to Windows XP Professional -- but I give it low marks for overall performance . If you are looking to make the leap to the Wireless-G protocol , and leave far behind the vestiges of the now obsolete ( in my mind anyway ) 11Mps standard , shy away from the `` Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G '' unless no other option is open to you .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Caution !

I began to have a bad feeling about this and reluctantly packed it up and sent it back.I sent the entire unit back per their instructions and received an amp that had no scratches on it back but minus the factory plastic protective bag and the manual that was sent with it ! ! ! The worst part was the right earpad ( I can not tell if it was the original or not ) began to make a static sound ! I decided at paying so much for the ESP that this should not happen and the cost of returning and sending them back was getting too prohibitive . It cost me a total of $ 80 bucks , and to take another chance at their `` crack '' lifetime warranty repair staff was something I was not going to do twice . Maybe this time they will make it perfect and the left earpad will start making a static sound to match the right and there goes another $ 40 plus a another lifetime warranty repair fee added ! Well they say the 3rd time is the charm . Probably the Koss repair department has that engraved on their front wall.To my surprise I received my refund minus the free shipping cost they offered ! I complained to Koss to refund my entire cost as the ESP was defective on their part and their famed lifetime warranty service made it worse , from defective to unusable . They refunded my total cost only after I threatened them to take it up the `` chain '' .Quality control or reliability is another issue as I found out some supposedly new ESP phones sound different from each other ( especially in the bass area ) or have cosmetic flaws , gold rusting on the logos or the earpads are mismatched in the cushioning areas . The inside of the amp seemed ill connected to the circuit board with connectors and the small bulb light not really lining up correctly , but it still was somewhat solid . Surprisingly the volume/balance knob worked fine and seemed accurate and firm . I am only complaining because at this price could n't they take the time to make sure at least it looked correct ? Conclusion : after thinking about this for awhile I decided these headphones may be too fragile and not worth my cost to own again and may weigh heavily against a future decision . I might have changed my mind had they just replaced it with new one pulled from the rack or maybe if the lifetime warranty service had done a careful `` audiophile '' job on it . ( I am particular at this price range ) . It 's also apparent to me that maybe their famed lifetime warranty service is not all `` cracked up '' to what it should be and I hate to think if I ever owned one and it needed repair that it is being repaired by people who do n't care for their product or have been working there too long ( maybe a lifetime ) and have only daily contempt for it.Currently looking for a new audiophile headphone to replace these . Though I doubt I can find an electrostatic one in this price range . It was an excellent value . Too bad ! I have not commented on the sound since it is an already `` proven '' electrostatic . But if it is something that is not reliable and the service behind it is the same , this puts it in a `` useless '' category that is not even worth commenting about its purpose.PROS : Excellent Value ( when it works ) Includes everything to play or connect with.It 's portable.Comes with a quality real leather carry-all bag.Lifetime Warranty Service ( in name only ) Longtime manufacturing record of ESP with no changes to model.It is comparable or better to the Stax headphones.CONS : Lifetime Warranty Service ( You 'll go broke using this unreliable service . See below ) .Shipping cost plus Koss repair fee can be prohibitive and a deal breaker if not fixed correctly the first time.Poor 2nd tier customer care ( less ) service both via their no response e-mail service and phone.Manual is just a single semi-gloss fold out paper ( no color ) , no wonder they trashed it ! Comes unsealed in an ill-fitting box.Some quality control issues.COMMON PROBLEMS : Rust on the Gold Logos.Headband can be hard to attach to earphones.CONCLUSION : Buy these headphones only from the factory . You pay a lot more but it will be guaranteed brand new . I would recommend these headphones only to those that just want extreme low distortion and a very flat response up and down the bandwidth and understand how this applies to the music you will listen to and do n't mind an unreliable repair department for a lifetime .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I do n't believe that these batteries are fresh .

I like simple , hard working devices and the Palm OS is almost Zen like in it 's simplicity and usability ( read : reliable ) .For the last year I have been using a Motorola P935 pager and in doing so , convinced myself that I could do without a full size laptop becuase I needed extreme portability , but I was missing functionality ( wireless web/email access ) . It sends email , but only up to 500 characters and sometimes that is not enough.I use this device extensively both on the job and off . While travelling from Texas to the East Coast I work 80-100 hours a week , run a small online business , manage my investments and keep track of an enormous amount of personal information.Coupled with the Omnisky Minstrel Wireless Modem the Handspring Prism is a true champion for power packed portability . I find the coverage in Houston and the Boston/Providence/Narraganset area to be more than adequate.The TO DO list is great and the repeatable function is great for reminders such as filling out time sheets with straight time during the week and time + 1/2/double time on the weekends . It also interfaces with the calendar so that you can view your open items along with scheduled times.I do not synchronize very often , but when I do it seems to work well.I use a 8mb backup module all of the time because I have had a lockup that caused me to lose all of my data , but this was once and it was for a very avoidable mistake : I was synchronizing with Omnisky over the wireless connection to update my software and lost the connection , corrupting the files . After the backup , I accomplished this same task several times but under controlled conditions ( not moving around ) .There are a lot of great games for the Prism and the color looks great . I do n't play many games , but I do enjoy Sim City.The graffitti text entry is ok , I 've picked it up , but I will be soon adding the & quot ; Halfkeyboard & quot ; after reading the reviews about the folding Targus model . Again , this decision was for portability.One bad thing : The battery does run down fast . I have to charge it every day , and sometimes more than that with heavy use . I have a easy travel charger , so it is not a big deal and it does charge fast.I am able to take this device in the field , jot down information and action items and keep everything organized .

Let me tell you , as an unmanaged switch , it works . I connected it to my router , and then plugged in my Roku , Xbox , and Blu-Ray player , and viola , they 're connected to my network . So , it does its basic job okay , at least.But I wanted more than that . This thing promises network monitoring , VLANs , and bandwidth control . Supposedly , it can give you that ... IF you 're running an older version of Windows ! Instead of a web-based interface like most modern devices , this thing requires you to use Windows-based software that only works on older versions of Windows . All I have in my home now is Win7 64-bit and Mac OSX , and `` administration software '' is n't available for either of them . ( The Netgear website called `` NETGEAR Product compatibility for Microsoft Windows 7 '' does n't mention this router at all , if that tells you anything . ) While trying to learn how to operate this thing , I learned about other unpleasant quirks it has . Apparently it uses UDP for administration login , and broadcasts your login unencrypted across your entire network . ( If you do n't know why this is bad , then you do n't need a router with `` extra '' features anyway , go buy the cheapest unmanaged router you can find instead . ) That brings me to my conclusion : While this switch works on a basic level , it 's perfect for nobody . If you do n't need extra features and just want an unmanaged switch , get a cheaper-but-better one from someone like Asus or Buffalo . If you DO want a switch with extra management and monitoring features , you should buy one with a web-based interface so you never get screwed on ( lack of ) OS support . Netgear makes one , the GS108T , but it costs more and I 'm not sure I 'll trust Netgear again for a long time anyway .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "We were looking to upgrade from a less powerful binocular for bird watching .

I 'd steer clear , but they are cheap and readily availableThe first indication should be the price : These headphones are only 19 dollars . It 's hard to nail down Sony 's market for these things , exactly , but judging by their appearance and `` reference headphones '' name they 're trying to pass these things off as high output sound booth style 'phones.The headphones have nice large earmuff style cups on them , with foam padding and a cloth cover . They fit my ears fine , and I have big ugly stick-out ears , so chances are these things wo n't have laws-of-physics conflicts with too many people 's ears . I did notice that the headband is a little tight and it certainly is n't very flexible . If you have a melon head you may not want to wear these for long periods of time . The headband is also very hard to adjust , at least on my pair , and is so tight it feels like I 'm about to break it every time I resize it . It does stay put very well , though , so it is likely a set-and-forget sort of thing unless multiple people will be using the 'phones.How 's the sound ? Well , it [ stinks ] . But it can be fixed . Sony boasts a bass response of 12 hz for these 'phones , which is a boldfaced lie . If you did get the cones on these things to resonate at 12 hz you certainly would n't be able to play much else through them at the same time . As far as concrete audio frequencies go these 'phones do no better than any other cheap ones on the market , but Sony decided to `` atone '' for this by jacking up the bass volume on these things to insane levels . I could n't get much else out of these headphones without creative use of a treble boost and an equalizer , and even then only at moderate volumes . It 's trendy to pack entirely more bass than you realistically need these days ( just check out just about everyone 's custom car stereos ) , but in a pair of headphones it 's ludicrous . If the audio gizmo you want to use these with does n't have good bass and treble controls , tough . In that case you are n't getting much out of these 'phones.If you can tone the bass down a bit these 'phones are average and quite suitable for non-critical listening , but professional headphones they ai n't , and accurate their sound rendition is n't , but cheap they are .

The controls are overwhelming at times , provided you are a neo-phyte like myself.Second , for exterior photography on the normal setting , this camera can not be beat ! It is exceptional . The images are clear , clean , and colors are spectacular . I 've photographed NASCAR at the California Speedway , and other events like the Coronado Speed Festival , etc. , and the outdoor shots look great . Now for the indoor-shooting ... This is where the camera gets its two star rating from me . I do not know how to select the manual control on-the-fly . I 've tried to set up controls to shoot indoor photography , but I do n't have weeks and weeks to learn the settings . I 've photographed people who are standing completely still , slightly moving ( my kids ) , low lighting conditions , fair lighting conditions , and still can not get proper images to come out.The indoor photography is pitiful , as the colors are yellowish , muted , and nearly 90 % of the time , the images are all blurred . The pop-up light is only good for 5-8 feet at best . I took some special shots of people who were stationary , and it appeared that the photo looked `` good '' when zooming in and out with the control . When I downloaded the CF card to my PC , the images were always blurred and the colors were way off.Mind you , I 'm not a camera professional like many of the reviewers here , but rather I 'm just an average `` Joe '' who would like to have decent indoor pictures that looked natural and were not blurred.I would sell this thing on Ebay if I could get more than a few hundred dollars for it , but I 've already invested over $ 1,200 for the snap-on lens adaptors and protective lens cover which keeps the retractable lens from getting damaged . I bought this from a company in Canada back in 2003.All in all I 'm happy with the exterior photos , but am very , very , disappointed with indoor pictures . I guess this thing requires a lot of tweaking , and many , many hours of studying the little manual that Nikon has provided.I would stay away from this and save your money for the newer Digital SLR 's .

The D460 is a fine camera - I was generally very pleased with it . But having owned the D460Zoom for six months , I found two major faults . First , the & quot ; boot-up time & quot ; ( how quickly after you turn the camera on that it is ready to shoot ) and the lack of & quot ; burst & quot ; shooting ( the ability to take one shot quickly after another ) . These two faults lead to frustration when trying to take any type of action photos with the D460 . You see the action emerging , but the camera is still booting up ; you take a shot , but the action gets better and you want to take another but the D460 says & quot ; not yet & quot ; because it is still writing the first photo to the media . Infuriating.The D490 addresses each of these problems beautifully . Boot up time is about 20 % faster . Timing both of my cameras side-by-side , the D490 is faster ( 1.1 seconds versus 1.3 seconds , in five trials using the same 32Mb media cards ) . More important than boot up time is burst shooting . The D490 has a RAM buffer that allows you to take about 1 shot per second in the & quot ; HQ & quot ; mode ( 2.1 megapixels with JPEG compression ) . The D460 requires about 2.5 seconds between shoots in the same & quot ; HQ & quot ; mode ( but the resolution is 1.3 megapixels ) . Also nifty if you are using the TFT screen to take shots , there is a & quot ; gas gauge & quot ; showing you how full the memory buffer is as you are shooting.I simply ca n't express how happy these faster response time made me , especially at this price . I was so unhappy with the D460 's sluggishness that I was about to buy the $ 900 Olympus C3030 . Similar to the C3030 , the D490 also can take QuickTime movies ( though much shorter ones ) . Another nice D490 feature is that you can erase all photos off a card while the card is still in the camera , instead of having to do the erasing on your computer ( I often forget to erase after downloading to the computer , put the media card back in and find it still full when I want to take more pictures ) .While the D490 lacks the C3030 's B & amp ; W options it does have the two more important features - the QuickTime movies and the burst shooting ( both admittedly not as good as the C3030 , but likely good enough for most of us ) . Beyond the $ 400 saving , the D490 still retains a much smaller footprint ; it can easily slip into a pants or shirt pocket.As for the enhancement from 1.3 to 2.1 megapixels ( D460 vs D490 ) , I ca n't really tell much difference . I took two identical shots both & quot ; HQ & quot ; mode , printed them 4x6 on my HP970Cxi ; they look the same . Currently the D490 is about $ 100 more than the D460 .
