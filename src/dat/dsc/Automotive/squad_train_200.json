So the wife and I have recently returned from a wonderful 4 month trip around the USA . We left home on April 26 , and returned on August 19th . We towed a 29 ' Airstream . Naturally during that time we used theCamco 44622 RV Wheel Stop ( Large ) a lot . We also used the [ ASIN : B0012FEN0K Camco 44642 RV Wheel Stop with Padlock ] ] on the opposite side . I purchased them both at the same time 7 months earlier . I did use them before posting my original review , but I used them daily for nearly 4 months since this past April . Both are relatively easy to put on and remove and they seem secure , but we did have a serious incident which scared the H*ll out of us and is why I 've lowered my original stars from 5 to 2.DO NOT trust these devices to prevent your trailer from rolling . We nearly had a serious accident in a state campground in New Mexico where we were on a slight back to front incline . At the time these devices were all we were using to hold our wheels . Our tongue jack was resting on aValterra A10-0900 Red Trailer Tongue Jack Stand . In my opinion , another dangerous product . Long story short , the Camco Wheel Stops did not hold and our trailer rolled back over a foot tipping off the Valterra Jack Stand , crashing our tongue jack to the ground . After changing our britches and finding that , fortunately , nothing had been damaged other than our egos , we jacked the tongue back up and placed rocks behind and between our wheels to chock them . We immediately stopped using the Valterra Jack Stand . Temporarily I used some of the yellow interlocking leveling blocks I purchased at Camping World , covered with an 8 '' 2x6 . Eventually I got a scrap piece of an 8x6 beam and cut it to 8x8x6 . This makes a nice , wide , squat tongues rest and it will not tip over . We also purchased some good old fashioned wheel chocks and continued to always back up our Camco Wheel Stops with wheel chocks.We were lucky , neither of us were hurt and no damage was done .

But a few days later , it actually did NOT kill the display after shutting off automatically with one tire , so it was n't just by design , it seems to just be totally intermittent.The ability to set a pressure and let it stop when it hits that pressure is a great concept , but this thing has n't worked anything nearly as advertised . I set if for 38 PSI , since my tires max at 44 , and the manufacturer suggests 33 , but I like a little stiffer wheels than that . On one tire it shut off about 37.5 , on another I had to stop it at 39 myself because it never did shut off . On the other two it was about 37.5 or so , acceptable .

The tire that was inflated to 39 PSI before I shut it off myself was actually at 41 . One of the ones that shut off about 37.5 , one was actually 35 , one was actually 37.Then there 's the issue with the rubber inside the valve piece .

July 23 , 2013 on the rear of our 2006 Lincoln Town Car and it looks just right . It 's made of chrome plated metal ( zinc ) not plastic . As received , the chrome finish is fine , but after reading reviews about it deteriorating , I gave it a coat of Simoniz front and back including the mounting tabs before mounting . Hope it will help to retard oxidation . I replaced the UGLY black dealership advertising frame with this one and it looks great . Many cars have only two mounting screw anchors at the top of the plate . Initially with the two screws tightened , the bottom of the plate stuck out . I had to gently bend the license plate very slightly to make it not quite flat so it fit flush with the frame at the bottom and all around . It might also be corrected by adding two SHORT mounting screws and nuts to attach the bottom of the plate to only the frame tabs.The `` perimeter '' frame mounts BEHIND the license plate hiding the mounting tabs , thereby exposing the entire plate : just the simple narrow chrome frame shows . Also , no grief from fussy police or vehicle inspectors because of an obscured state name , motto , etc . I found very few available perimeter frames and for Amazon 's cheap price of this one , if it only lasts a year I 'll buy a couple more of them . Will likely buy one or two for our other car as well . I would have given it 5 stars , but for the possible impending corrosion mentioned in several reviews . Mounting screws were not included with the frame.Update 4/5/14 Uh , oh . Downgraded to 2 stars.The nasty snowy , salty winter we had here in NJ took its toll and pitted the chrome frames despite the Simoniz treatment .

I had a filter that was not `` hand tight '' as many expect them to be when they 're ready to slide under and twist them off with just a light touch of pressure . The filter on my 1999 Expedition is right behind the bumper so I 'm not sure if that placement exposes it more to the elements and makes removal more difficult or if the filter was last replaced and tightened way too much ... last change was by a Ford dealer because it was a freebie . I clamped onto the top of the filter and it immediately punched holes into it with the claws that are suppose to grip the filter ... and then came the oil down my arm . I tried again at the base of the filter where there 's a little more metal and immediately got another set of holes . I went for the strap wrench but that would n't budge it either . I finally got it off with my KR Tools 12153 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliers . I know all filters are n't difficult to remove but I 've been changing my oil & filters ... plus most repairs ... for about 50 years and this is not the only filter I have had problems removing .

I have purchased quite a few TEKTON tools on Amazon from wrenches to sockets and have not been disappointed ... until now . Lastly , if your filter is on tight you should be able to exert enough pressure with a tool to get it off without punching holes in it.Since I was able to get it off with the pliersKR Tools 12153 Pro Series 16-Inch Groove Joint Pliersthat would seem to be the better tool investment if you have a large filter ... at least the jaws have more teeth for a better grip , the teeth are not likely to puncture the filter , it has a lot more potential for other uses where an oil wrench does not and the price is about the same .

This year , the car passed everything fine with the same record , except NOx at 15 mph . Reading online said that this is the place to fail if your car is going to fail . Prior years , the number was 50 , with a max limit of 480 or so . This year , it went up to 780.So , I bought seafoam and , unlike a lot of other people , my car hardly smoked at all . I baby my car usually ( short shift , cruise at 60-65 , easy on the gas and brake and clutch ) all in the name of gas mileage . With only an intake , exhaust , and headers , I average into the mid 40 's for gas mileage average , when the EPA for the car is 25/33.I 'm not sure if this is something to do with my car getting old and the Catylitic converter is getting bad , but after Seafoam , the car registered a barely pass of 460 out of 480 max.For those of you who wonder , I added the seafoam through the brake booster vacuum line . This , from what I have been told , is good for a quick fix and to pass smog . I later dumped the rest of the can ( 2/3 left ) into the gas tank . Its hard to notice , but I believe the car idles a bit easier ( no gushing kind of noises ) . Could be cleaning the injectors.Whatever the case , I passed smog and plan on using this the next time I go in for a smog 2 years from now.I read a lot of forums online and there is great debate over seafoam .

If you car leaks oil already , or you believe it has the possibility to with engine cleaning , do n't buy this . But if you have high NOx or other figures , this is is a good buy to pass smog .

First of all , it was packaged well from Amazon.com , they like to use the air pocket material for packing , which works great , and is less messy then foam peanuts . The charger comes inside a plastic packaging case with both alligator and permanent wiring connectors . It also comes with a warrantee slip and a paper manual . The first thing I noticed was how light weight the charger is , right around 3-LBS , as opposed to my heavy 8-LBS fast charger counterpart.I really like the cables the charger comes with , the alligator clip ends are made of actual copper , which as you know , allow for better conductivity , which is why copper is used on computer heat sinks to dissipate heat . This particular wire also includes an 7.5-AMP inline fuse , with a cover over it to keep water out . At the other end of the wire uses a proprietary connector system , so that you can disconnect it from the charger incase of emergency , without the need to unplug the charger ! The permanent style wire , uses your typical battery bolt type connectors , which allow you to permanently install the charger , for year round use . This also uses a 7.5-AMP inline fuse , and also uses the proprietary connector at the other end . All I had to do to hook it up was , connect the alligators to the battery , connect the other end to the charger output wire , and then plug in the power , that simple ! The first thing I saw was a steady `` RED '' light , to indicate that the charger was charging the battery . However , since my battery was at 12-volts at the get go , it did n't take long for the charger to start flashing the `` GREEN '' light , which indicates battery at 80 % charged . Remember , a fully charged battery will actually show 13.5 to 14.5 volts . So , it took a while , charging at a 1.2-AMP interval , to get my battery there.TIP : With a lot of modern day vehicles , they have onboard systems which have a low power draw off the battery at all times while the vehicle is sitting . This is unfortunate , as the charger only charges at a 1.2-AMP interval , any onboard systems sucking that amount , will keep the charger from charging your battery . In this particular case , it is best to disconnect your battery from your vehicle.Once my battery was charged , it went into float mode . You know when its in float mode , when the `` RED '' light goes off and the `` GREEN '' light stays on steady . At this point of time , it is not putting a charge on my battery . But it will wait till it drops due to the freezing temperature , and then it will kick back on till its charged again . Think of it like the furnace in your home , the heater comes on when the temperature falls , and turns off when the temperature reaches your set temp setting.CONCLUSION : My fast charger would always be very warm when I used it , but the BTPLUS is only luke warm , you hardly even notice it ! My fast charger also emitted a noticeable loud humming sound , my BTPLUS emits a sound so quiet , that you have to put your ear up to the charger to hear it ! My fast charger has the ability to cook a battery and destroy it , where as the BTPLUS will maintain my battery and make it last a long time . Sometimes people think that speed is everything , I say no , cause when it comes to batteries , slower is better . The way I look at it is , this is an awesome charger , and I recommend it with 5-stars !", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "so happy to receive it sooner than I thought . got very disappointed with all missing stuff in the box . manual etc .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "match my existing wheel chocks .

While it is battery powered , and does n't really pose any kind of roadside fire hazard , its usefulness is severely limited.First of all , one has to rely on always having it loaded with good batteries . Dead batteries do noone any good , and I 've found most people just throw items like this in the trunk or glove box , and forget about it , not really thinking to check the batteries regularly.But does it work ? Well yes , sort of . The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off , or lights up continuously . The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light , while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists . Unfortunately , the LED is not very bright , and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards , and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed , it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon . While we certainly do n't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers , we also do n't want something so dim that it does n't trigger anyone 's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway ? Forget it , buy some reflective triangles . Rural highways ? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds . Well lit neighborhoods ? It likely wo n't get noticed . From my perspective , about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under , and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides . Then , if your vehicle 's hazard flashers do n't work , by all means this is better than absolutely nothing . Just remember to check the batteries .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I wish this had rigid dividers instead of just fabric .

It 's a Cadillac CTS , and the only black areas are around the front and rear fascia , and the door pillars . But these black plastic parts had begun to fade after about 2 years . The car is even garage kept most of the time . Many of the black trim restoring products on Amazon have a wide range of reviews ; from 1 to 5 stars for most if not every similar product . I chose Mothers because I use many of their other products , typically with good results . Back to Black did not disappoint . I applied it to the plastic trim around the fascia using `` 12pcs Waxing Polish Wax Foam Sponge Applicator Pads Fit for Clean Car Vehicle Auto Glass High_quality Yellow Useful NEW '' ( from Amazon ) which are ideal for this task . Mothers instructions state that the area should be buffed after application . I found buffing unnecessary on the trim around the fascia . I did try buffing at first , but these areas are somewhat rough-textured and seemed to absorb the liquid fairly quickly . Buffing did not change the appearance.However , on the door pillars , the texture is smooth and buffing did make a appreciable difference there . Buffing with a soft towel helped to more evenly distribute the Back to Black , eliminating some minor streaking resulting from application . Buffing also improved the gloss of the black color , which would have been more like flat black prior to buffing . So whether to buff or not depends on the type of material where the product is being applied . Back to Black is also very good at removing any excess wax that gets on the fascia trim areas.Most of the negative reviews of this and similar black detailing products are because they need periodic reapplication . I found this to be true also of Back to Black . But no black detailer is going to be a miracle product and last forever .

U am here to say otherwise.The first is someone stated they are having issues with this sealant causing swirls . No liquid , in any way , will ever put swirls in a car . The one product that wi is the applicator you are using to apply the product . Always make sure you have a good microfiber or foam applicator.Second , and the one people have the most difficulty with , is how hard it is to wipe this off . This is a wipe on wipe off product that applies very very thinly to your car . The proper application is to dampen your applicator with water , put some klasse in a small spray bottle and spritz it on the applicator . Then apply to a small section and immediately wipe off . The longer you wait , the harder it will be to remove.This stuff is meant to last and it does . Traditional waxes would have to be applied on the entire car and then you would wait and then wipe off . This is a sealant , it requires little time to cure or adhere to your paint.I use this and a 33oz bottle I figure will last me at least 5 years , applying one coat twice a year on a mid size sedan.Klasse is very slick . After a rainfall , the only thing that is wet afterwards is the trunk and center of the roof , as those are the only flat parts.It also gives off a great shine and lasts me 6 months with washing twice a week.If there are some spots you missed and the product has dried on or is too hard to remove , simply apply more and rub off .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "they work - and increase the volume of blast from my bike - but be prepared to sort out the wiring on your own ...", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I must have misunderstood how this siphon works .

My car was covered with a stubborn deposit of dirt and grime that simply would not come off with a car wash . It seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and would n't budge no matter how hard I tried washing the car . After every car wash , I would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty.That was when I learned about Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit . The results were astounding ! After using it , the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth . The paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it had a new coat of paint ! I was immensely pleased with the results.Unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants , auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay . The clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine ( Play-doh ) and it is used along with the included `` lubricant '' spray ( actually , an auto soap that provide lots of suds -- like Meguiar 's Gold Class -- will work equally well . ) Mind you , car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches ; only a car polish or a polishing compound ( harsher ) can do that . And remember , always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants . Also , clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new ! I am giving Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit my highest recommendation . Go on , try it and see for yourself firsthand the difference it makes in your car paint .
