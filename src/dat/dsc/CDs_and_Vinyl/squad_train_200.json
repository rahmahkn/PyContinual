I think this is a very good song , although not as good as My Evil Twin or The Statue Got Me High.Time- 3:26 Rating : 5/514 . If I Was n't Shy- Boring .

The reasons are complex , but one reason was that the Monkees , Peter Tork , Michael Nesmith , Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz , were dissatisfied with the format of the television show and they wanted to appeal to a more adult audience . Once the television show ended , the Monkees decided to declare their freedom with a movie , which eventually was called `` Head . `` The movie has no opening credits and no plot . Some have called the movie a visual `` stream of consciousness . '' Others have called it psychedelic , anti-war , and anti-commercialism . In fact , the movie is all of the above as well as a uniquely artistic film . Elements of `` Head '' can be seen in some later films ; perhaps most notably in the Mel Brooks film `` Blazing Saddles . `` The movie is free-form movie-making , with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafaelson tying together vignettes focusing on key images and concepts throughout the film . Some of the concepts are quite complex . The box seen in several places in the film represents the room built for the boys at the studio , but also represents the trap the boys felt they were in while making the Monkees television show . In another aspect , the box also represents the constraints of commercialism and being pigeon-holed by fans.There are several songs used in this movie that count as some of the best ever made by The Monkees . `` The Porpoise Song '' is easily one of the best Monkees songs recorded . The live version of `` Circle Sky '' is another winner . Other good songs include `` Can You Dig It '' and `` Do I Have to Do this All Over Again . '' There are some weak songs as well , and the soundtrack for this movie is definitely a mixed bag of quality.Another interesting feature of this film is the cameos . Actor Annette Funicello , boxer Sonny Liston , Actor Vitto Scotti , football star Ray Nitschke , famed musician Frank Zappa , actor Teri Garr , and actor Victor Mature all made appearances . Jack Nicholson can be seen briefly in one scene . Gossip queen Rona Barrett appears . Toni Basil performs as a dancer . The list of cameos includes many more well known individuals.This movie also contains a strong link to another ground-breaking film , `` Easy Rider . '' Many of the people involved in the making of this movie participated in `` Easy Rider '' the following year , and the gold helmet used in that film came from this movie.The question that one must inevitably face in any review is who will like this film and who will not . The people who will like this film fall into two groups . People who considered the Monkees a serious group and empathized with their desires to break out of the cookie cutter mold created by television will enjoy this film . Students of cinematography and avant-garde film techniques will see a rare example of a studio produced experimental film . Those students will also immediately see the inspiration for later films . Fans of the Monkees television show have had differing opinions about this movie . I was a fan of the show and I enjoyed the movie . However , others have felt that the movie is worthless . If you like experimentation and you enjoy psychedelic movies from the late 1960 's , particularly if you ever liked The Monkees , you might wish to give this film a try.The Monkees were a cultural phenomenon . The group was originally meant to capitalize on the success of the Beatles , but they ended up being much more . The four boys of the Monkees showed that just because they were chosen to be on a comedy show , they still had talent and they had an incredible amount of influence . The Monkees refused to be placed in a niche by television , even if it meant that they gave up an award-winning and successful television show to do so . `` Head '' remains a unique film that would be impossible to imagine making today . We are fortunate that The Monkees were able to stay with this project long enough to see it made , and more fortunate that Jack Nicholson and many of the other people involved in the film were sufficiently enthused about the film to keep working on it even though several of the key individuals involved lost interest while it was being made .

If there was stellar material to add it would n't be much of a problem , but I think that the folks at Universal realized the bonus material did n't quite fit . For the bonus material on the second disc they add the songs from the Mike 's Murder soundtrack that had vocals and one side of the live double album that heavily featured songs from `` Night & Day '' . Why not just digitally remaster these & release them as complete albums ? Of course , they probably will eventually get around to it & then you 'll have to shell out some more $ $ $ to Universal to get them.While it 's nice to get demo material for this recording , these demo versions have to sound closer to the actual album versions than any demos I 've heard . The `` demos '' are basically the album tracks , but with just piano , Joe 's voice & synths/drums , no additional instruments.To add to all these shortcomings , there actually is material from this period that could have been released on this reissue as bonus material , but was n't . First , the spanish versions released on the `` Real Men '' EP & used as b-sides on singles ( El Cancer , El Blanco , & Un Otro Mundo ) . Then there was also the 12 '' Extended version of TV Age & I think there was another 12 '' version or perhaps instrumental version of one of the other album songs . None of this studio material was included , not to mention any of the unreleased live material from this time.The packaging is a double digipack , which wo n't stand up over time ( likely to tear ) & is annoying to have to pull out of the sleeve ( which has the actual track listing on it ) just to open it up & pull out the discs before you can play them . The included booklet has the obligatory new liner notes from someone no one 's heard of , and they do include information on musicians for tracks , but there 's only 1 picture of one of the original 7 '' s & no info on the original singles or album 's release ( pictures , dates & countries released , charting etc. ) . The liner notes do include the song lyrics though.So what reason is there to fork over the exorbitant amount they are asking for this `` expanded '' issue rather than ripping it ? None . And the music industry wants to know why CD sales are plummeting . It 's not just because of file-sharing . It 's because the music industry releases pathetic stuff like this & asks you to fork over a day 's wage for it .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Lay down and avoid !

Of course Dizzy shined on all three songs in my opinion . Since I am a drummer I have to admit that I was surprised by Chuck Lampkin 's drum kit . In 1961 double rack toms ( the two tom toms on the bass drum ) were rare even in rock , and especially so in jazz . Also , many jazz drummers of the era played Gretsch drums , so it was surprising to me to see him playing Rogers . I will say his playing was superb.Coltrane 's set is what his fans come to expect . Trane somehow managed to impart an aura of spirituality in his live playing , and it managed to come through on this televised segment as well.A word about Gleason : as some have rightfully said , he comes across as , well , a dork .

I 'm clearly much older than the intended audience , and I have no little rugrats of my own to share this movie with ( to be fair though , this is obviously a kids movie that grownups can also enjoy ) . In fact ( although whatever computer program that decided I should be put on the Disney marketing mailing list would n't have known ) , I 've reached my present age without ever having seen the film BAMBI before . So , for me , this is n't a nostalgic look back at a film I loved as a child . It is n't a happy reunion with something that thrilled me years ago , something which contains many happy memories . For me , it was just another film , albeit one with a grand reputation . But I watched it and enjoyed it ; although I 'm clearly not seeing it in the same mind-frame that others do.This is a very leisurely and pleasant film . It 's willing to feature slow pans across lovingly painted backdrops of forest rather than quick-cuts and lots of action . The script is more interested in presenting a mood rather than telling a story , and it 's offered in a way that I quite enjoyed . The characters are simple without coming across as stereotypes . There 's a quote from Walt Disney that reads , `` Until a character becomes a personality , it can not be believed . '' Well , I think he succeeded ( my favorite character was the grumpy , bad-tempered , old owl ) . I ca n't say that I adored the film , but I 'm glad I spent the time watching it . It covers a lot of the same ground embraced by other children 's stories , but it did so with great confidence and an pure kind of style.In many ways this is a much more innocent movie than what we would expect nowadays . On the other hand , I was vaguely surprised at how dark portions of it were . The sections of the film dealing with the encounters between the animals and the humans are , of course , well known ( even I knew about Bambi 's mother ) and well remembered . And I must admit to being a bit baffled by the sequence in which several female critters hide in the bushes like snipers and one-by-one pick off unsuspecting members of the male animal kingdom for , um , marriage ( or whatever ) . It 's an ... old-fashioned view of male-female relationships , I suppose . A relatively harmless but overwhelmingly male-centric view of the world , I still found it slightly creepy . It would no doubt be handled differently today , though I suspect there would n't feature any actual improvement . The female skunks and rabbits would probably be having wardrobe malfunctions all over the place to attract their men.The two DVDs contain more than anyone who loves this film would ever want and the set gets an extra star just for all the DVD features . Not being familiar with the movie , I really was n't interested in this , although I 'm sure that when the list of features was announced a few months ago there were a lot of classic film buffs ( and Disney fans ) salivating wildly . However , the one item this film-viewer appreciated more than anything was the digital restoration . Whether you like the movie or not , you ca n't help but be impressed by how crisp the picture is , how bright the colors are and how clear the sound is . It really looks and sounds wonderful . I suspect for many people , this is what makes the set worth buying.One thing I did n't like about this double-disc set is the advertising all over the place . It 's bad enough having to sit through ads and trailers before you get to the main menu , but the annoyances do n't even end there . I realize I 'm watching a `` Disney DVD '' and that it 's been restored and that it 's digitally optimized for my magic whatsit converter thingie ! Why on Earth do I need to see giant signs with bold letters telling me this before starting the feature ? I must have fast-forwarded though three minutes of boasting . In addition to the filler on the discs , the DVD case also contains more junk than is necessary . I can understand them putting in fliers promoting release dates for future DVDs ; that makes perfect sense . But posters ? Magazines ? There 's an advertisement for food in here for heaven 's sake ! In any event , I finally got introduced to one of the most famous and beloved children 's movies of all time . Had it not been sent to me out of the blue , I probably would have spent another few decades without knowing it . I 'm glad I did though . I liked it , even if I 'm not sure I 'll ever feel a staggering desire to watch it again . For people casually interested , at least a rental is in order .

The band had spent the 1970s creating monstrous ambient freak-outs , universe-sized abstract cosmic soundscapes that swirled and pulsed . They developed a formula whereby a giant synthesiser would produce a bouncing rhythmic sequence , and the band would improvise over the top of this with Mellotron , flute , guitar , and whatever came to hand . By the end of the 1970s this was wearing thin , and the bandmembers were growing tired of each other . There was a brief go at turning Tangerine Dream into a conventional prog-rock band , with drums and vocals , but by the early 1980s the group had adopted a modernistic , clean synth-rock sound.Like the rest of Tangerine Dream 's live albums , Logos consists of music comparable to but not otherwise heard on the group 's contemporary studio recordings . As I understand it , the music on Logos is only a small part of the band 's set from that night ; it is apparently the first five minutes of the evening 's concert followed by the last half hour . The odd thing is that it divides neatly into two halves , a good half and a dull , anonymous half . I 'll say up-front that I have heard Tangerine Dream live concerts from 1981 and 1984 ( on the band 's second bootleg box set , and on the official live album `` Poland ) , and I prefer them to Logos . They are conceptually similar , with the same basic sound , but they are moodier and more tasteful . Logos is nonetheless a frustrating album , because although it is mostly inferior to Poland , one section is very good , but not quite good enough to warrant buying the album.Still , on the positive side , it 's a very accessible record . People tend to love or hate Tangerine Dream 's epic space music of the 1970s , whereas Logos has mass appeal . It has notes and chords . It has tunes and basslines and drum machines , although the drum machines sound feeble and play feeble patterns . Compared to the same drum machines wielded by Kraftwerk or Throbbing Gristle , at the same time , Tangerine Dream 's drum programming in 1982 was perfunctory.The first few minutes are slow and atmospheric , but there is only so much a band can do with an ominous drone , and so most of the album is fairly animated , with blippy sequences and Casiotone drums . In general , Tangerine Dream fill a lot of space with soloing , which works in the first section , because there is a strong melody and a well-defined , melancholic mood . Later in the record the soloing is just dull . It 's notable that the solos on Poland - sometimes with guitar - were strong and interesting , whereas Logos sounds almost childish at times . One of the problems that faced Tangerine Dream , as they abandoned pure atmosphere in favour of melody , is that it is easy to tell when a melody is trite and simple , whereas pure atmosphere is abstract . The band 's abstract cosmic improvisations of the 1970s will not date , because they sound like nothing else from the period . On the other hand , a lot of Logos sounds like early-80s television soundtrack music , particularly the section from 36:00 onwards , which could easily have been used in one of the Police Academy films , perhaps to underscore a beach party . The final minutes strive for epic majesty , but fail badly . One of the best definitions of camp that I have read is that camp is `` failed seriousness '' , and this is often the case with Logos . The tasteless poppy bits undermine the moody , dramatic sections , turning them into the electronic equivalent of the `` Dragnet '' theme tune.The instruments sound old-fashioned . Kraftwerk 's synthesiser pop of the 1970s has dated , but it has dated in a charming way , whereas Logos puts me in mind of Blue Thunder and Airwolf and Knight Rider . Tangerine Dream had their pick of all the modern synthesizers of the early 1980s , and I suspect they did not take the time to sit back and ponder whether they liked PRESET 12 : FM CLUNK because it was good , or just because it was new . Perhaps I react this way because I was alive in the early 1980s . Perhaps people born in the 1990s will be stunned by this vintage electronic masterpiece . To be fair , the band might have simply had a bad night - the 1981 and 1984 concerts have not dated so badly , even the drum programming in the 1981 concert is superior.Still , back to Logos . The theme that comes in at about 20:00 is super . I first heard it on the soundtrack of the film The Keep , indeed it is the reason I bought the album . It is powerful , it sounds massive , you can hum it , you can tap your feet to it . It 's simple and hypnotic . It also sounds a bit like `` Bette Davis Eyes '' by Kim Carnes . It skirts very close to camp - the chords are almost too dramatic to take seriously - but I remember that it worked well in the film , and it is undeniably vivid.After that point the album has nothing much of interest . It reminds me of the incidental music from Legend , but less focussed . It also reminds me of Steve Hillage 's contemporary synth-pop album FOR TO NEXT , which had a whiff of Tangerine Dream about it . It was a dull , uninteresting album , but it pointed the way to greater things . Steve Hillage went on create System 7 , a band that made some excellent ambient music in the 1990s , whereas Tangerine Dream 's music nose-dived in quality as the 1980s continued . It was not inevitable that this would happen.Overall therefore I recommend you buy Poland instead . It 's a better Tangerine Dream live album , and a better album overall ; it is the band 's swan song . On the evidence of Logos it is hard to see why people remember Tangerine Dream , whereas Poland has something . Also , if you can get hold of the 1981 concert on the box set , do so - it 's almost as good as Poland , despite being three years older .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "This CD rocks .

It 's comparable to meeting a friend from high school again after four years of college , and finding out he 's converted to some obscure , pantheistic , tribal religion . He 's enthusiastic about it , and really wants to get you pumped up about it , too , but all you can think about while listening is the old friend who talked about nothing but football and whose diet consisted solely of jalapeno-flavored Cheetos . In less than five years , the person you remembered is now someone completely different.Load is ostensibly a Metallica record , but much like your friend , they 've abandoned their Cheetos for religion . Okay , perhaps the analogy is starting to break down now . I should say , they abandoned any trace of intelligence and creativity for simplistic drivel . It may be a natural progression from The Black Album , in that it further lightens Metallica 's sound and ventures more into different styles , but it lacks that album 's redeeming qualities . Where The Black Album incorporated new ideas alongside their old ones to create something new while still maintaining their identity , Load simply cribs other genres wholesale and creates largely unsatisfying derivatives of them.Keep in mind , this was 1996 , and grunge was in full-force . Load was clearly an attempt to grab a piece of the pie , what with its blues elements , Hetfield 's southern rock style vocals , and slow , meandering songs that frequently go nowhere . Now , I 'm not trying to imply grunge is bad ; Alice in Chains is one of the better bands I 've ever heard , and I listen to Soundgarden frequently as well . I like grunge . Load is not good grunge . Load is not good rock , either . Heck , Load is not good country during its brief flirtation with it.I ca n't say there is n't anything worthwhile here . `` Bleeding Me '' is actually a pretty fantastic song , `` King Nothing '' and `` Ai n't My Bitch '' are serviceable rockers , and `` Until It Sleeps '' is a decent lighter song to break up the monotony . That 's four good songs , plus `` Hero of the Day '' and `` 2x4 '' , which are listenable despite having some flaws . Six worthwhile songs sounds good , but that 's out of fourteen . Yes , Load has fourteen tracks , and runs for a colossal 78 minutes and 59 seconds . Metallica thought that was impressive enough to feature predominantly on the album cover , but I think it 's generally a bad business move to let your audience know how long they 'll be sentenced to musical purgatory if they buy it . I 'm a believer in quality over quantity when it comes to music , and it would have been much better if Load was half the length it ended up being.In the end , half of Load simply ends up being boring . `` The House Jack Built '' , `` Cure '' , `` Poor Twisted Me '' , `` Thorn Within '' , and `` Ronnie '' are simplistic , repetitive , and leave no lasting impression on the listener . `` Mama Said '' has essentially the same problem , with the added offense of country , while `` The Outlaw Torn '' is decent , but about six minutes too long . Load is essentially musical junk food , and while there 's nothing wrong with that if it 's what you want , it 's insulting coming from Metallica , a band talented enough to write far better songs . It 's the musical equivalent of Stanley Kubrick directing Transformers . Transformers is n't bad in and of itself , but it 's far below the level of the man who directed 2001 : A Space Odyssey.The good news is , this is the worse that Metallica ever got ( yes , I consider St. Anger to be better than Load , by a significant margin ) .

Of course , there are those who do n't even like that , and the new releases of the CD do n't feature it , but an original copy of the vinyl edition may just have something going for it ... Now , though , with the benefit of over 20 years of hindsight , it can be seen that `` Cyclone '' was just one experiment to try to determine the future direction of a group suffering greatly from the loss of one of its most inspirational members.There can be no doubt that Peter Baumann 's precipitate departure from the trio in 1977 deprived Tangerine Dream of a highly important and enormously creative influence . ( It is a sad fact of artistic life that the most creative forces are often also the most destructive ! ) `` Cyclone '' was the soul fruit of the collaboration between the two remaining members of the band ( Edgar Froese and Christoph Franke ) and two others : percussionist , Klaus Krieger and flautist , Steve Jolliffe . This latter brought to the album not only woodwind playing ( in the form of flutes , clarinets and cor anglais ) but also another , entirely new element for the band : lyrics . ( Add dramatic chord of your own choosing at this point ! ) Many commentators have attributed the unpopularity of `` Cyclone '' to Steve Jolliffe 's fairly outlandish lyrics and vocal style but I think that this assessment is most unfair . After all , they feature in less than a third of the album in total and for the most part fit in well with the material around them . True , there are times when Jolliffe 's rather brash delivery is at odds with established Tangerine Dream leanings . But his wordless and vocoded passages are entirely consistent with previous TD practices and mesh seamlessly with the synthesised sounds . In addition , his detractors say , his lyrics are often pretentious or just plain meaningless . Well , most of the pop industry does quite well out of pretentiousness , thank you very much ! And why is music with 'meaningless ' lyrics any less meaningful than music with no lyrics at all ? Think about that one for a bit . Answers on anything that suits you ... ( used banknotes of any denomination preferred ... ) No : if there are weaknesses to be identified in the music presented on `` Cyclone '' , it has to be the overall lack of clear direction for the album , coupled with the unimaginative and often just plain boring percussion lines which underpin some of it ( especially around the vocal lines ) . Klaus Krieger 's skills are entirely wasted in these standard pop percussion figures , which are entirely superfluous to the TD mix . Personally , I suspect that the real reason for this album 's lack of popularity with the established Tangerine Dream fans of its time is that those fans had come to think of the band ( quite erroneously ) as a pure synthesiser trio - something that set them apart from other bands of the time . Suddenly , with `` Cyclone '' , Tangerine Dream were a quartet , complete with 'standard pop ' drummer and vocalist . And basically just like any other boring old pop group . Couple this with the fact that other artists like Brian Eno and Ultravox were breaking new ground with their forays into synthesised sounds and one can understand that `` Cyclone '' was a grave disappointment indeed at the time.So : turning away from idle ( and pointless ) speculation , what does the music actually sound like ? The album opens with one of its highlights : a beautiful passage for vocoded voice ( & agrave ; la Pink Floyd `` Animals '' ) as an introduction to 'Bent Cold Sidewalk ' . This 13-minute track is in three sections of roughly equal size : the first section features the aforementioned much-maligned lyrics of Steve Jolliffe , here integrating well with rich , supporting synth textures ( although the trite drum line is rather irritating ) . The middle section is mostly instrumental ( there is a patch of wordless - or at least unintelligible - voice towards its end ) and introduces a change of mood , with Jolliffe 's lilting flute and woodwind contribution harking back to the days of `` Alpha Centauri '' . With a strong sequencer pulse and a wandering cymbal-based percussion line , this is probably the strongest ( and by far the most beautiful ) music on the album . A drum burst brings this central section to a close , though , reprising material from the opening section . Jolliffe 's vocal contribution here does begin to jar , and he has certainly outstaying his welcome by the end of the track . ( The track 's ABA form is another departure for TD , who usually continue to introduce material right through to a track 's ending . ) The following 'Rising Runner Missed by Endless Sender ' is a fast and furious 5-minute romp of a work , through which Jolliffe shouts and screams , sobs and sighs his way , with his own particular brand of surreal lyrics . He is kept company by a screaming lead synth line over a throbbing bass synth pulse as well as by some fairly innocuous drumming from Krieger.The final track , 'Madrigal Meridian ' , is a much larger scale work . At 24 minutes long , it originally occupied the whole of the second side of the vinyl disc . Stylistically , the music here harks back to a variety of earlier TD works ( and has no vocals at all ! ) . It starts out with some 'cosmic ' style electronic ambiences , through which a throbbing synthesiser pulse finally hammers its way , forcing the sound to dissolve into soaring string textures . Suddenly , a strong sequencer pulse erupts and a typical TD synthesiser melody of delightful simplicity takes over . The first half of this track is very reminiscent of both `` Stratosfear '' and `` Ricochet '' , with its catchy tunes and driving rhythms , coupled with some fabulously uninhibited guitar-playing from Edgar Froese . After almost 20 minutes of this delightful stuff , the material gradually disintegrates both melodically and rhythmically , until a series of crashing chords introduce a short lyrical section for synthesised harpsichord and strings , and a brief interlude for flute . The track 's peaceful ( but unresolved and therefore ultimately unsatisfying ) conclusion is spoiled further by some truly cringe-worthy intonation problems - something of a shame , as it leaves the listener finally feeling that this album really could have been very much better than it is.Worth a visit if you 're at all curious but Tangerine Dream have done much better than this in their time .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Mariah Carey has long been looked at as one of my idols .

You can call it the basic Doors . When Morrison sings in Strange Days : ` we shall go on playing or find a new town ' , I always think of Paris were I 've seen his grave on P & egrave ; re La Chaise . The playing had stopped ; he found a new town were his playing stopped definitively ... ( When you 're on the graveyard his grave is n't hard to find . You just follow the marks other Doors-fans left to show you the way . ) Strange days is one of my favourite Doors-songs because of the way the strangeness of life in a great combination of music and lyrics is brought to us . Especialy when the song is played we have to agree : this certainly is the strangest life we 've ever known . The album has more moments with that nice touch of melancholic filosophy.There are some down to earth songs on the record too : You 're Lost Little Girl and Unhappy Girl are typical Doors-songs about love/women with a little twist . Love Me Two Times is a nice little blues with the small touch of male-ignorance a good blues should always have : ` one for tomorrow and one just for today ' . Moonlight Drive is maybe not as striking as some other Doors-material , but it has a very consequent metafore in it . ( Lesser Gods on the poetic stage tend to forget what metafore they using halfway their lyrics . ) As a not native speaker I liked to sing along with the ` going down'-part at the end of the song with a low voice , without thinking about what it meant . Well , let 's put it like this : when they 've managed to swim to the moon and climb to the sky , they have to come down again . Morrison was a decent man.Horse Latitudes is more poetry and free- ` jazz ' than rock . The contrast of down-to-earth ( blues ) material and the ` stranger ' music that is typical for all Doors-albums is very much present on this album . Horse Latitudes is placed between the two earlier mentioned blues songs.The almost simplesounding song People Are Strange has the same contrast . The music is very happy but when you take the lyrics seriously there 's nothing happy about this song . It 's wellknown : ` people are strange , when you 're a strangerfaces look ugly when you 're alonewomen seem wicked when you 're unwantedstreets are uneven when you 're down'You should compare the lyrics to L'America of the album L.A. Woman ( see my review ) . ` friendly strangers came to townall the people put them downbut the women love their wayscome again some other day'At least the women started to like the unwanted.The two lovesongs that follow have the same theme but they contradict eachother in a way . I 'm talking about My Eyes Have Seen You and I Ca n't See Your Face In My Mind . The lyrics are still allright considering the fact that they 're just two lovesongs.But then something happens . Manzarek digs deep inside his organ and there it is : When The Music 's Over . Another song of great theatrical suspence and terribly good lyrics . Songs like this had never been done before , exept by the Doors themselves in The End . The tension in this song reaches it 's highest point when the music dies out and we ` hear a very geantle sound ' ... 'we want the world and we want it ... 'Since I know songs like this exist , I 've been looking for them . There 's not much around . I found one band that can play the same trick on me as The Doors did when I was about 15 years old . There an instrumtal band tough . A jazzband from Scandinavia , called the Esbjorn Svensson Trio . See them live and find out what I mean . They 're coming to America soon .

There is some fiction images throughout the movie along with behind the scenes and real day life action footage with each members of the band .

In my circles a heated debate always brews about the best guitarist etc . I am sure any avid rock listener has experienced this - clapton , van hailen , Stevie ray v , Steve via , the edge , page and countless others lead the debates.This much I do recall at one point in one of these `` rock '' brothel debates someone uttered : slash is not in this group ! He is a best sidelines at best ! Of course I was appalled and got into a fiery fist of words on this ! I am not looking for street crud either . While listening to all his albums since GNR I noticed something amazing with Slash . He really carries himself in that `` guitarist mentality '' mantra and thrives at it ! The proof is in the rock n roll pudding ! I want anyone to nominate anyone else besides Sir Clapton forward whom successfully had immersed himself with other Grade A artists and made amazing projects ! ! ! Slash brings a certain style of humility and creativity all in one . I absolutely see his work as being a collective of many directions . Yet again I must emphasize the basic core from which he has grown : he gracefully has written `` his '' material and went to all the artists and not the other way around . That takes humility and a certain fineness to showcase when playing with Ozzy or Lemmy and the countless others ! And the best part is when he plays `` his '' material alongside with these artists , you can still hear remnants of the guest artist in Slash 's guitar playing ! If thats not artistic growth then I do n't know what is ! But enough goofing off and let me congratulate him on his latest project with Sir Kennedy !

They sang their very camp arrangement of `` Mr Sandman '' , which I 'm happy to own on their truly brilliant CD album which was recorded in 1992 ( and released in 1994 ) : `` The Flirtations Live : Out on the Road '' The Flirtations Live : Out on the Road . I believe that it is simply and blatantly a massive wrongdoing for the soundtrack album of Hollywood 's first major gay-themed film to have excluded this openly gay group , who were not only supremely talented musicians , but also vital gay community activists . Michael Callen died in 1993 ( the year of the film 's release ) from AIDS related illness . He was open and honest about being HIV positive and maintained a high profile among ACTUP ( AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power ) activists who demanded government action on drug research and hastened availability . Michael was also a pioneer proponent of the concept of `` safe sex '' through condom use in order to limit the spread of HIV.There 's a 4th February 1994 Entertainment Weekly article by Melina Gerosa ( in their issue # 208 ) in which she writes : `` If you enjoyed the 30 seconds of a cappella singing during the party scene in Jonathan Demme 's Philadelphia , do n't rush out and buy the soundtrack album .

''We 're attracting more and more straight and & 'homosexually challenged ' people every day , '' Arterton , 48 , says .

The network was swamped with would-be fans , who were directed to the only places you can find their albums : progressive and gay bookstores ( and select Tower outlets ) . Later that year , on Donahue , the group serenaded the first televised gay wedding.Being excluded from the soundtrack album was a disappointment ( `` We kept waiting , but they never asked , '' says Arterton ) , but the Flirts have since faced a much graver loss : the AIDS-related death last December 27 of Callen . ''I wish he could have seen the film , '' says Arterton , who notes that the group has no plans to replace its beloved soprano . ''He was such a media whore -- it would have been very like him to dish it .

I knew all the words . Hell , I even choreographed a dance to & quot ; Step By Step & quot ; and tried to convince my dad that & quot ; Tonight & quot ; sounds like a cross between & quot ; Ob La Di , Ob La Da & quot ; and & quot ; Penny Lane. & quot ; Although there are no limits to Step by Step 's missteps , I have to give them credit for stepping outside the bounds of gooey bubble gum pop and into the kind of territory that will end your teen idol career as fast as it began . Unlike the Kids ' self-titled debut and Hangin ' Tough , this swan song to teenage stardom incorporates a surprising diversity in music styles ... & quot ; Step By Step & quot ; reassures the Kids ' loyal audience that they 're still in the pop game , but it really serves as a Trojan Horse to dupe those dumb teenagers into shelling out their parents ' dough for the rest of Step by Step -- essentially , a collection of failed experiments the session musicians could n't even save , like the Rico-Suave-esque reggae swamp , & quot ; Stay With Me Baby , & quot ; and the softcore rap , & quot ; Games. & quot ; And let & quot ; Tonight & quot ; and & quot ; Where Do We go From Here & quot ; serve as a extreme caution to any boy bands foolishly ambitious enough to make any attempt to musically pay homage to the Beatles ... please take heed of these atrocities and aspire to more attainable standards , like , say ... Bananarama.Another bonus : whereas on the previous albums , Joe and Jordan took the Lennon-McCartney vocal-hog reins , on Step By Step , all five New Kids are utilized to their fullest potential . Danny Wood can ( sort of ) rap ! And he 's not the only one ... judging by Donnie 's searing , dis-filled rhymes on & quot ; Never Gon na Fall in Love Again , & quot ; he would probably school his younger bro Marky Mark in a rap-off on 8-mile Road , yo . And contrary to popular belief , Jonathan Knight is not a mute ... like you and me , he can sing a lame-o hack job of & quot ; Happy Birthday & quot ; really really badly ... who knew ? So what brought on this sudden collective effort on the mic ? In some circles , it was believed that the New Kids overthrew Maurice Starr 's authority over their careers and kicked him to the curb , thus allowing Jordan and Joey to go on tour with the Stylisitics and the rest of the New Kids to step into the recording studio for the first time ever . Another branch on the grapevine contended that because Joey had ventured past the age of 14 , suddenly his soprano pipes lost in a battle with a new , deep , ugly voice called puberty , and the other Kids had to make up for his absence , since Jordan could n't do it alone ( what with his inevitable fledgling solo career on the wings ) . The New Baritone Joey was brave enough to go on the record with & quot ; Where Do We Go From Here , & quot ; but try to get through the track without cringing and longing to listen to & quot ; Please Do n't Go Girl & quot ; on repeat . With Joe all grown up and forbidden to sing , Jordan single-handedly carries the group vocally with his stellar Barry Gibb impersonations , particularly on & quot ; Step By Step. & quot ; As usual , it is his voice that makes the New Kids . I ca n't help feeling cheated that he did n't do a Justin Timberlake-style rise to solo stardom . He could have really rocked my body.Like watching old Baywatch episodes while tight-rolling my stone-washed jeans , tucking the cuffs under my socks , and slipping on my lace-free Keds , I always find a buried fondness in my heart for treasures I onced loved but am now embarrassed to admit it . This is the way I feel about the New Kids on the Block 's Step By Step .

The arrangements , style , and sound do tend to sameness on the first listenings , but after more hearings you realize that each song has its own texture and style . The album has some of the chill of Gaucho , the jazzy chord-changes of Katy Lied and Aja , and the sound of Kamakiriad .

Fagen 's vocals are recognizable , but his voice sounds weaker and breathier now than in Steely Dan 's heyday.Steely Dan puts most bands to shame . At a time when most groups are just sampling ( i.e. , stealing from ) old hits , Steely Dan continues to practice the art of composition , arrangement , and performance , with intelligent , sophisticated , and catchy songs.Be patient with the album .

These Bach Violin Concertos ( and previous recordings ) show Andrew Manze to obviously be a violinist of extreme technical ability as far as negotiating complex passages , however what he has in complex passages work he is lacking in flowing melodic line , solid intonation , smooth articulation and beauty of sound . His playing often sounds scratchy , awkward and uneven . The tone he emits from his instrument is not attractive and his phrasing sounds unnatural.Let 's look at the A minor concerto in detail and compare it to Jaap Schroder/Academy of Ancient Music/Christopher Hogwood 's recording on Decca 400 080 ( IDN 3259140008026 Out-of-print ) or ( A Minor Concerto on Uni/L'Oiseau-Lyre - # 43326 ASIN : B000004CYD and E Major Concerto on Pgd/L'Oiseau-Lyre - # 448178 ASIN : B000004CYP ) .Let 's talk about the engineering of the recording , first . When the A minor recording first started I was struck by the boxy closed-in sound of the Manze recording and it 's lack of high overtones from the baroque violins . The prominence of the Manze 's violin overpowers the orchestra . On the other hand , Schroder 's recording is much better balanced with a really nice ambiance to the recording with a decay time of about 2 seconds , perfect . Schroder 's recording has the nice high bright silky overtones which the original instruments should have.For the performance , Manze shows uneven articulation and wavering intonation that is not enjoyable to listen to . Also , there is a lack of what I would call buoyancy to the Manze recording . Schroder has a command of the music with solid intonation combined with smooth articulation . Schroder 's fast movements are buoyant and soaring when needed . While listening to the slow movement of the Schroder recording , I was lulled into ecstasy . Manze , on the other hand takes the slow movement too slow and his tone is uneven during long notes . In one instance he reaches a high note and there is a definite slide up into the note that is very irritating.As a side note , another alternate recording that is almost as good if not as good in it 's own way as the Schroder recording is the one by Elizabeth Wallfisch on Virgin Records - # 61558 ( ASIN : B00000J2PS ) .All in all , the Manze recording of Bach 's Violin Concertos makes for an unsatisfying listening experience .

This is a very fine performance from the Teatro di San Carlo , where it was first staged in 1837 and first revived ( with the Turkish diva Leyla Gencer - available on Opera Doro ) in 1964.This may be a dress rehearsal since the auditorium is half empty ( the premiere was on May 28 1998 ) . Even though it means that there is less give and take with a responsive audience , the singers seem to benefit from the less oppressive presence of the Neapolitan operatic mob . There are no signs of anxiety , everyone warms up to their roles from the first note . Everyone , including the conductor and orchestra are in top shape and give their very best . ( Old European opera houses are infested with gangs of homicidal tradition keepers : if a singer as much as misses one note , the conductor stops the performance , conducts a hasty requiem mass and the wretched singer is dispatched to his creator with a short , sharp shock , from a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block . These frequent executions are part of an East European conspiracy to take over the opera houses of Europe , since they sustain the need for a constant supply of fresh talent from the east bloc ) .The camera crew takes advantage of the higher freedom of movement with sweeping movements that cover the orchestra pit ( and occasionally the stage ) almost side to side , with a very dynamic effect . This is the best camera work I 've seen in any `` live '' opera production on a DVD so far ( although it 's not unusual on rock/pop videos ) . The picture quality is excellent , with vivid colors and well defined picture . The 5.1 Dolby surround sound is the best audio so far on any opera DVD : very focused , with a pleasing feel of `` air '' around the voices , that carries this hollowed auditorium 's sonic signature.Bulgarian soprano Alexandrina Pendatchanska won the 1990 UNISA international singing competition in South Africa . She is Ghena Dimitrova 's student and prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; e , who is reported to have said on Bulgarian television that her student has a truly remarkable talent . A talent indeed she is . In the lyrical passages she has that young girl sound of the old Italian school - light , agile and plaintive . When she digs the spurs in the voice becomes strong and full , almost metallic and quite thrilling . Her superb Elisabetta is musically and dramatically almost overwhelming . She tears into the final scene with ferocity and real pathos . Her voice is expressing both strength and vulnerability in every phrase and the queen 's physical decadence is laid devastatingly bare - an unforgettable performance.Giuseppe Sabbatini in the title role has a such a charismatic stage presence that it is little wonder that the queen almost loses her mind over him . His Devereux is the impetuous heart breaker as well as proudly aristocratic . He is a real artist and stylist and seems to be very well versed in 19th century stylistic practice . His medium-weight voice enables him to bring out the qualities of a bel canto tenor , as well as to project a more dramatic presence . ( The historic Devereux , the 2nd earl of Essex was executed after he tried to organize a revolt against Elisabeth - nothing to do with a love triangle . He constantly provoked her - she put up with his impudence for years because he was her cousin . But she gradually grew alarmed of his behavior , finding him to be & quot ; a nature not to be ruled. & quot ; During one of their disputes , Essex turned his back upon the queen , who promptly slapped his face . He organized the revolt after she confined him to house arrest , following an unsuccessful campaign in Ireland . ) Italian lyric baritone Roberto Servile has a real personality and a wonderful voice . It is quite rare to hear such perfect diction and precise phrasing even from an Italian singer . I found his performance the most satisfying of this cast because of his unusual respect for the text , combined with his lyrical timbre and big voice that fills the auditorium with no hint of strain . His Duke is very convincing in his transformation from the loyal friend to the wronged , raging and vindictive husband . Hungarian soprano Ildik & oacute ; Koml & oacute ; si as his consort is more restrained than Pendatchanska in her singing and acting and thereby provides a musical-dramatic counterpoint . She sings Octavian on the Palermo Der Rosenkavalier DVD that is due to appear later this month.The success of the performance owes much to the sensitive conducting of Alain Guingal that sustains and inspires the singers rather than drowning them.The costumes and sets are gorgeous - all the elements of this production fit in perfectly and are very well thought out , from Koml & oacute ; si 's sad demeanor in the opening scene to the blazing red of Sabatini 's costume.Roberto Devereux is scheduled to open this season at the NYC Opera with Lauren Flanigan as Elisabetta .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "In the mid-1990s Deutsche Grammophon boasted of their sound quality by advertising their stereo CDs with not a little hyperbole as wonders of `` 4D Sound '' . Karlheinz Stockhausen 's `` Gruppen '' seems like one of the best pieces to choose to show off how your recording system faithfully reproduces the original space , and the disc is rounded off by two orchestral pieces by Gyorgy Kurtag . `` Gruppen '' for three orchestras ( 1955-57 ) is probably the greatest thing Stockhausen has ever written . The three orchestras are placed to the left , centre , and right of the audience respectively and exploits this spatial separation by having themes thrown from orchestra to orchestra , making it seem like the very sound is moving . Though written at the height of 1950s serialism , it 's a light and airy piece that any audiences but the `` classical music stopped with Brahms '' conservatives are sure to enjoy . However , in spite of the best efforts of studio engineers , this piece simply does n't work in a stereo downmix . A 5.1 surround version is desparately needed , and one wonders why Stockhausen-Verlag at least has n't provided this yet . Furthermore , this performance is filled with misreadings of the score . Compare it to any of the other recordings out there ( Boulez et al. , Rattle et al. , and the definitive recording from Stockhausen himself ) and you 'll spot a plethora of mistakes.Gyorgy Kurtag is one of the most fascinating figures of the 20th century , with a unique blend of dark Bartokian sonorities and Webern-like brevity . Though his oeuvre slowly but steadily proceded from an opus number one string quartet in the late 1950s , he arrived on the international stage only when Pierre Boulez took up his music in the early 1980s , when the composer was nearly sixty . Most of Kurtag on disc , however , is for soloists or small ensembles , and this disc finally brought his orchestral music to home listeners.Like the Stockhausen , Kurtag 's `` Gravestone for Stephen '' op . 15c ( 1989 ) exploits the performance space by widely dispersing the players . It is the most stripped down piece I 've ever heard from the composer . For most of its 9-minute length a guitar plays ascending scales at very low dynamic with the slightest of accompaniment by strings at even lower dynamics . Only at the midpoint do we get a few sad calls from the brass , before the music returns to the guitar and strings . Were the piece not written to commemorate the dead -- the husband of Marianne Stein , the French psychologist who led Kurtag out of compositional crisis in the 1950 -- the limited musical material would seem as fluffy and insubstantial as the typical output of Rautavaara . Its anguished tones do move the listener somewhat , however.The more ambitious `` Stele '' op . 33 ( 1994 ) is written for large orchestra in three movements , though at not much over ten minutes long it continues the composer 's tendency to think short . The first movement consists of soft microtonal writing with prominent winds . The second begins with a buzzing , aleatoric-sounding soundscape reminiscent of Lutoslawski 's second symphony before exploring various portions of the orchestra and then fading out with soft strings . The third movement is a slow ostinato on low instruments . It 's an impressive exploitation of the possibilities of a large orchestra , though somewhat directionless.Though I enjoy `` Grabstein fuer Stephan '' and `` Stelae '' , especially the latter , I find Kurtag to be more impressive in the chamber music -- especially the string quartets -- and piano solo genres . But that could be due to Abbado 's reading of the pieces , which are untrustworthy . Watching Abbado prepare the pieces under Kurtag 's supervision on the documentaryThe Matchstick Mandocumentary , I got the impression that Abbado just did n't really understand what he was doing . `` Grabstein fuer Stephan '' has been recorded on a Col Legno disc , where Peter Eotvos conducts , and I 'm going to need to track that down.Besides the lame reading of `` Gruppen '' and the untrustworthiness of the `` Kurtag '' performances , another objectionable thing about this disc is that it contains only 44 minutes of music . Could nothing else be found to fill it out ? All in all , I give the disc two stars , but since Kurtag 's orchestral works are difficult to find in recording , fans of that composer are probably going to make do with this disc anyway , and that hurts . If you are looking for an introduction to Kurtag , get theArditti Quartet performanceof the string quartets . Likewise , encountering Stockhausen here for the first here would be disastrous . Lovers of modernism need to get to grips with Stockhausen 's work at least for its historical importance if not the pure enjoyment in it , but as much as it 's a pain in the neck to order , the definitive discs from Stockhausen-Verlag are the way to do it .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I enjoyed seeing It 's Arbor Day , Charlie Brown again as I am a very big fan of Vince Guarldi 's music .

Why not ? Chris Hillman , the last of the original Byrds ( besides McGuinn ) , had checked out , replaced by John York . Clarence White had already replaced the departed Gram Parson , and Gene Parsons had replaced Kevin Kelley who had replaced Michael Clarke . The Byrds were a new band . Why not pursue a new musical direction ? Imagine how it must have been : after all the arguments and fights with David Crosby ; and having to re-record several of the vocals on `` Sweetheart of the Rodeo '' to offset Gram Parsons ' dominance . The relief McGuinn must have felt making an album and not being challenged at every turn . Bliss ! The new Byrds went into the studio , and did it McGuinn 's way . And McGuinn in turn , trusted Bob Johnston completely with production . Same with the album artwork . McGuinn had the concept and trusted the creative guys at Columbia to get the cover right . `` I trust everything will turn out all right , '' McGuinn used to say.Not this time . Imagine McGuinn 's disappointment . The sound mix Johnston produced was not at all what McGuinn had in mind , and the album cover missed the mark completely . And then there was the single , `` Lay Lady Lay '' sounding like some gospel group with an all-girl choir , yet another of Johnson 's bad ideas . Was this really the Byrds ? McGuinn said he liked the new Byrds ' album . What else was he going to say to the press ? Years later , however , it was a different story . He admitted he 'd been bitterly disappointment with `` Dr. Byrds and Mr . Hyde . '' The song selection was n't the best , and the singing sounded rough and not at all like the Byrds . The only consolation was the showcasing of Clarence White 's flawless flat-picking . Johnston got that much right . Next time , McGuinn would call in Terry Melcher and restore the Byrds ' sound . Next time . Luckily , Columbia Records still had faith in the Byrds ' franchise and there would be a next time.In hindsight , `` Dr. Byrds and Mr. Hyde '' was yet another bad career choice , after the equally bad career choice to go all country with `` Sweetheart of the Rodeo .

It 's awful.It 's frankly difficult to imagine a worse example of navel-gazing erected into such a pompous , self-impressed musical monument . Nearly every song on this album expresses bland ( and unexplained ) angst as though it were an Apocalypse .

[ from 'Nobody home ' ] Feeling sorry for yourself , as George C. Scott once remarked , is the most popular indoor sport : it rarely makes for artistic greatness , however . And here the listener is being asked to choke on two whole jars of it.Some of the songs are of such absurd brevity as to leave the listener with a cheated feeling ; others are inexplicably bookended by random fragments of dialogue or puzzling sound effects .

This movie manages to transcend genres , a witty film that those who have outgrown the `` Madeleine '' cartoons will enjoy.Madeleine , played by the excellent Hatty Jones , is a little French girl at a boarding school in France , along with eleven other girls ( also flawlessly acted ) and their teacher Miss Clavel ( Frances McDormand ) . The movie follows her clashes with the Spanish ambassador 's son , Pepito , and with Lord `` Cuckooface '' Covington , the man who owns the school upon the death of their sponsor -- and who wants to close it down ; also with such problems as a ransom plot , and the loyal dog Genevieve.Madeleine purists should be warned : this movie is not just a live-action version of the book stories . The movie exists as a series of vignettes loosely based on the books , such as Madeleine 's appendectomy and her rescue by Genevieve . Two of the central plots are not in the books , however : Lord Covington 's wish to sell the school , and the kidnapping plot concerning Pepito . Occasionally dialogue will be lifted ( a difficulty , given the almost complete lack of REAL dialogue ) such as Miss Clavel 's midnight `` Something is not right '' or Madeleine 's defiant `` pooh pooh ! `` The actors and script contain the necessary amount of innocent cuteness and comedy ( the visits of the various ambassadors to the school ) while also having poignancy . One thing that will irritate Madeleine purists is Madeleine 's family situation in this movie , but it does give her the ability to interact with Lord Covington.McDormand is excellent as the rather put-upon nun Miss Clavel , who stiffly glides through real life while trying to keep her twelve little girls in something approaching order without squelching them . Thank God the old `` authority figure as clown '' thing never came into play . Hatty Jones is cute and sprightly without being annoyingly so , while the actresses for such characters as Vicki and Chantal are perfect in their roles . The girls REGISTER as being real people . So does Kristian de la Osa , as the attention-hungry Pepito -- the movie hints quietly at why he is such a `` bad hat , '' while simultaneously giving us sympathy for him and Madeleine alike . And kudos to the best original character , Helene the cook ! Music is overall very good ( thankfully no one breaks into spontaneous song ) with sedate music playing for Miss Clavel and the girls , sad music during poignant moments , and excellent Spanish numbers as we focus on Pepito . The final number stinks , though , it clashes with the setting and plotline.The minimal violence is cartoonish and there is no innuendo ; one ( bad word ) creeps into the script , via a bad guy.This movie is a delight from start to finish , a witty and charming movie that will take you back to your childhood .

Hardly delicate , listening to this album is like being stuck on an elevator hearing dinosaurs fart.The main problem I have with this album is that it is just simply BORING : dull , lifeless , uninspired and pedestrian to the bone . This is quite a shocker when you consider that Pink Floyd were one of the best live rock bands in the 1970s . There is nothing transcendent about this record ; not even attempts by the band to innovate their classics on stage . Then again , that 's probably a good thing because when they DO try , the results are embarrassing . Take note the hideous saxophone solo on `` Shine on You Crazy Diamond '' ( Dick Parry , we miss you ) and the agonizingly slow rendition of `` Comfortably Numb '' , where Roger Waters ' vocal parts were replaced by a bunch of average vocal harmonies that would make George Martin vomit . The worst offenders , by far , are `` Money '' and `` Run Like Hell '' : the former is extended into an insufferable jam featuring horrible bass playing by newbie Guy Pratt and the latter substitutes the original 's eerie menace for macho chest-beating that is exhausting rather than exhaustive . Roger , where are you when we need you ? Not surprisingly , the most listenable songs on this album are the ones from A Momentary Lapse of Reason ( 1987 ) but that 's not saying much because most of the songs from the record were horrible in the first place . The only songs from this album that actually improved from their studio counterparts are `` Learning to Fly '' , which removes that awful synthesizer riff from the original ; and `` Sorrow '' , which boasts even more impressive guitar playing than before . But whatever positives this album has ( which is very few ) are shattered by the negatives ( which are plenty ) .Anyone who considers Delicate Sound of Thunder as the comprehensive overview of Pink Floyd concerts are clearly misguided ; as stated before , in the 1970s , Pink Floyd were a force on stage and their best concerts rivaled that of Led Zeppelin . It 's not just because they had Waters ; when they were together , Floyd produced dazzling and unforgettable music . In fact , there are many bootleg albums out there to confirm this ( most notably Animal Instincts ) . But Delicate is not one of those albums . Far from comprehensive , Delicate confirms the inaccurate belief that Pink Floyd were a boring dinosaur act whose reasons for touring were for financial rather than artistic reasons.Delicate Sound of Thunder is not the best place to start if you want to get into Floyd concerts , that 's for damn sure . Check out Animal Instincts or even their Live 8 reunion and the difference in quality between those shows and Delicate are absolutely staggering .

It is also most certainly one of the very best first-outings by a rock group.Indeed The Doors were one of the most exciting , influential and controversial rock bands of the swinging sixties with the legendary genius Jim Morrison as The Doors lead singer , Ray Manzarek controlling the spiralling electric organ , John Denmore on drums and Robby Krieger on guirtar . The Doors never actually recruited a bass player so the sound was , endearingly , highlighted by Ray Manzarek 's predominant electric organ , providing a hypnotic backdrop for Jim Morrison 's captivating vocals , who rides through the inventive musical landscapes with finesse.The Doors ( 1967 ) album introduced the world to their adventurous , startling fusion of rock , blues , classical and jazz . These diverse blend of styles intertwine beautifully with the poetic , often thought-provoking lyrics , making for an incredibly powerful , innovative album that has set standard 's for generations.The albums opener is the belting and thoroughly infectious 'Break On Through ( To The Other Side ) ' , one of my personal favourite 's . 'Break On Through ' was also The Doors debut single release . The propulsive rhythm flows gloriously with notably nifty guirtar work courtesy of Robby Krieger , entwined with Ray Manzarek 's bewitching , ever-effective electric organ interludes and incessant , pounding drum beats from John Denmore , not to mention Jim Morrison 's rocketing vocals . An extremely credible start to the album and the single deserved far much more commercial recognition than it initially received at the time.The stomping , thunderous rock of 'Soul Kitchen ' is a cracking affair , complemented by Morrison 's mesmerising vocal delivery while the beguiling Oriental mystery of 'The Crystal Ship ' is a pure masterpiece ( as is the entire album ) , mellowing the mood somewhat.Beginning with a magical guirtar riff , blended with the customary electric organ , this leads us into another compelling , stomping rock number 'Twentieth Century Fox ' , while the fun 'Alabama Song ( Whisky Bar ) ' making for an immediately striking and rather diverting experiment . Morrison 's deep , sonorous voice pulsates seamlessly through all the enchanting ebbs and flows . 'Light My Fire ' is an out and out classic and one of The Doors major landmarks . Hauntingly atmospheric with its funeral-like electric organ backdrop and Morrison 's stirring delivery . They enjoyed their first real taste of significant commercial success and acceptance with 'Light My Fire ' , swiftly topping the US Billboard Chart ( though barely dented the UK Top 50 on its original release ; upon its re-issue in the summer of 1991 it flew up into the Top 10 ) . The full severn-minute version is a pure sonic masterpiece , allowing us to enjoy the groups ever-dynamic playing . Another utterly mesmerising and hypnotic afair.The mid-tempo rock number 'Back Door Man ' capture 's yet more powerful , expert playing , hosting a rich and deep performance from Morrison who also enhances the tremendous and startling production of 'I Looked At You'.The dreamy , mysterious 'End Of The Night ' highlights the groups remarkable affinity for shrewd , poetic , profound lyrics . Beautiful . 'Take It As It Comes ' kicks up the tempo again and this held ample commercial potential ( as did practically every track on here ) , while the tinkling 11-minute oedipal drama 'The End ' is literally spine-tingling and has to be one of The Doors most daring , compulsive outings that is completely haunting with its non-stop melodicism , dynamic tension and sombre , dreamy tone.This album is a pure masterpiece , ranking ( in my opinion ) among their very best , most innovative work .

This is where the group 's mastery of the technical came to the forefront like never before . There are so many vocal layers , and such a rich symphonic sound that by this point it was clear , the Beach Boys had something pretty special happening . However , it has all been said before . And my guess is you 're probably pretty sick of hearing about it . Pet Sounds is a classic so universally recognized that it seems silly for me to even bother reviewing it . But the fact remains , some of the Boy 's greatest tunes adorn this album . Also , some of the most sweetly naive and almost childlike lyrics on Pet Sounds color this period of the sixties permanently with the heartbreak of a nation 's collective loss of innocence . `` Would n't it Be Nice '' , `` Do n't Talk '' , `` Sloop John B '' , `` Caroline No '' ... These have all become part of the American musical landscape of the twentieth century , but that does n't mean they should n't still be appreciated for their almost hymnal beauty . And `` God Only Knows '' still stands as probably the greatest achievment in Brian Wilson 's storied career . Even though many contemporary musicians claim that the Beach Boys were a major influence on their music , I believe albums like Sunflower and Surf 's up actually sound more like modern pop than Pet Sounds does . The influence of the spirit of the late 60s Beach Boys though , and their interminable drive to push the musical envelope was great indeed . The Beach Boys of this period pretty much perfected pure pop , so unless the spirit of the music is once again channeled , today 's groups are just retreading old ground ... and I 'm not interested .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Apparently , their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down .

I do have to give the band credit for trying something different but the timing for it was just all wrong and it ended up failing miserably . Out of all the disco/R & B ; numbers on this album the only one I really like a lot is `` Back Chat '' . That song happens to have been written by bass player John Deacon , who also wrote `` Bites The Dust '' . Perhaps the rest of the band should have left the writing of the R & B ; type material to John because the rest of the band 's efforts in that area left something to be desired . `` Dancer '' and `` Body Language '' ( a U.S. Top 20 hit strangely enough but then again I 've never heard it played on the radio so perhaps that ranking is misleading ) are especially pitiful . Not even the added guitars on the remixed version of `` Body Language '' can save it . `` Staying Power '' at least sounded somewhat better when they performed it live . The rest of the album contains more standard type Queen songs , of which the best tracks are the David Bowie collaboration `` Under Pressure '' , the rocking `` Put Out The Fire '' , and the ballad `` Las Palabras De Amor '' .Here is how I rated each song on a scale of 1 to 5:1 .

Sometimes terrible sound quality is a dealbreaker when you 're considering a purchase , and when there are infinitely better recorded sets out there why even mess with this Krips set . Even if this was a superb interpretation and well played it would n't be worth purchasing until they remaster it well and clean it up , kind of like they did with Szell 's Brahms Symphonies 2 and 3 , which in it 's previous incarnation sounded so terrible , but when it was astonishingly remastered in the late 90 's , it ended up sounding better than the best DDD recordings .

I saw a few shows on the FII tour , and whenever these songs were played , I used the opportunity to use the men 's room .

Perhaps it was the addition of Derek Sherinian or the presence of Kevin Shirley , but we can not make excuses.My favorite track is the epic , 'Trial of Tears , ' with it 's dark atmosphere which reminds me of something they would have recorded on their AWAKE album . Most notable is the guitar playing of Petrucci which really takes on a kind of 'Allan Holdsworth-esque ' style . The ballads are also worth a 'thumbs-up ' - 'Anna Lee ' is a beautiful piece both lyrically and musically . Sherinian 's playing sounds good if Dream Theater were a pop band , but his limits are evident with his Elton John style playing . 'Hollow Years ' is an amazing acoustic guitar piece with some spanish influence . The remaining songs such as 'New Millennium , ' 'Take Away My Pain , ' and 'Lines in the Sand ' are decent songs , but they totally lack the instrumental 'edge ' that has never been absent in previous Dream Theater recordings .

I did n't realize that I was just a couple of years younger at that point than my dad was when the movie was originally released in '42.The beginning shows the superior artistry in telling the story . It comes across as real woods . For the most part , the animals behaved like animals ( though I do n't think deer talk to rabbits in real life ) .The best part of the DVD is the story board , where they go through the movie with the creators telling their thoughts about what to do and comparing it with previous movies.One part of the movie that is fantasy is that man is the only predator . In real life , the old wise owl and Flower would be preadators as well . Coyotes and wolves and mountain lions and bob cats were all absent from this forest.I found this a very scary movie when I was young . Parents would want to watch this with their kids , especially young ones .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The release of `` Grateful Dead : Dead Ahead '' to the DVD format has brought a flood of liquid memories coursing through the various synapses in my brain . I had originally gotten on 'the Bus ' ( with gusto ! ) at a Merriweather '82 concert . Thus begun my `` Looong Strange Triiipp '' of following Jerry & the boys during the Ronald Raygun ( ZAP ! ) years of the '80s . I have hazy college memories of duping a VHS to VHS copy of `` Dead Ahead '' at an off campus apartment , not far from Towson State University.Fast forward over twenty years later . There 's now a lot less hair on top of my head and a bit more ( O.K . a lot more ) belly on my frame ( Shades of Jerry ! ) . Still lovin ' the Dead , but I 'm getting a little snobby in my old age , mainly listening to their '70s material these days . I 'm taking down the family Halloween decorations , while my brand new copy of `` Dead Ahead '' is hitting the DVD laser . This grabs my 4 year old 's attention , because the TV lights up with an opening , trippy montage of band members , skeletons and other symbols ( which fascinates him ) . For those not up on their Dead History , in 1980 the Grateful Dead did a month long stint at both the Warfield in S.F . and Radio City Music Hall in NYC . `` Dead Ahead '' captures a Holloween night , when the band kicks back on the Radio City stage ( made up like a folksy , country porch at dusk ) and reaches back to their folk/jugband roots with acoustic instruments . Thats right ! The Dead were going unplugged , way before it became hip and the insideus weasles in the MTV Marketing Dept . co-opted the concept . Well as I 'm getting my work done ( with one eye on the TV ) I suddenly realize that I 'm humming the tunes and getting into the show ! There are just beautiful versions of songs like `` Uncle John 's Band '' and `` Ramble on Rose '' . I especially love Jerry 's guitar parts on `` Bird Song '' , which just seem to magically go on forever . By the time `` Ripple '' ends the acoustic portion of the show , I 'm in DeadHead Heaven ! Bravo GD ! The rest of the show is an electric set , which pretty much sums up the band 's '80s concerts . It features fine versions of `` Lost Sailor/St . of Circumstance '' , `` Franklin 's Tower '' and `` Fire on the Mt '' . Emceeing the show is SNL comedy team 'Franken & Davis ' . While they might not be everyone 's 'cup of tea ' I always found their persnickity , smart a** sense of humor , to be right on target to the Grateful Dead sensibility . I especially found their 'Henry Kissinger gets caught bootlegging a GD show ' ( featuring Mr. Bill Kreutzmann ) bit , pretty darn hilarious ! As for the DVD itself , not too bad . Love the DVD menus featuring the original concert artwork ( infamously hated by the Radio City management ) of two giant skeletons hanging out on the iconic venue . The picture quality and sound is OK and it 's the best your going to do with over twenty year old video tape . The DVD 's bonus section features 50 more minutes of material , not included in the show 's original release . This includes a beautiful acoustic/instrumental version of Bob Weir 's `` Heaven Help the Fool '' ( which I always thought of as a vastly underrated song ) . For a laid back evening of wonderful music , I highly recommend `` Grateful Dead : Dead Ahead '' .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Yes . I am still at this farm in Michigan . Why ? Becaue I have promised myself to stay here for peace and quiet while I review the Cream albums . But , tragedy struck again . Seems Bossy ( the cow ) somehow ate up all of Metamorpho 's food supply and I had to walk 30 miles to the nearest food store . ( Magic Seer 's carpet was in for repair ) , So I set out and realized that I had left my fur-lined Seer 's cape at home when a snow storm surprised me on the way . Luckily , a man in an old Dodge pick-up truck picked me up and gave me a ride . Amazingly , he recognized me and , for the price of an autographed picture , gave me a return trip ! What luck ! But , I suppose for being spiritual ( and a friend of the Universe ) , one is entitled to such perks . Nevermind all that . Cream 's EXCELLENT `` Wheels of Fire '' awaits us all.I must elucidate on these reviews . They are done , not only because the band is so reknown , but to explain why they are so . Positively , in the psychedelic sense , they progressed and moved the music into more formidable areas . What is so amazing is that they made this double c.d . set to show you what they are capable of in the studio- and live ! And this shows you the real talent behind this band . Not only could they construct inticate landscapes and unknown terrain in the studio-but also be mega as far as live recording . This was confidence of the highest order . And it shines through miraculously.What do we have here exactly ? We have Cream adhering to their `` traditional '' blues roots . On the first part they tackle Howlin ' Wolf 's excellent `` Sitting On Top of the World '' as well as `` Politician '' which is the best Howlin ' Wolf song not written by Howlin ' Wolf ( accolades to Jack Bruce on this one ) . `` Born Under a Bad Sign '' also reflects the blues-but in a more controlled and upbeat fashion . Definitely superb ! The second part-needless to say , extends blues in live fashion and never lets up . The jams , the leads , are to die for ( I hate to be banal but even Metamorpho has laspes sometime ) .I can not say enough about Jack Bruce on the first part . Superb songwriting and construction . He extends himself to bleak areas . `` White Room '' , although pristine , gets soiled by disappointment . The lively riff is juxtaposed against feelings ; and especially lines like `` where the shadows run from themselves '' are as vivid and unique and understood as being exemplary . `` As You Said '' employs his wonderful acoustic guitar ( with cellos ! ) and interesting construction insofar as chords and keys . What are they Jack ? Sharps and flats I am sure , but maybe 5ths , 9ths , and sustained ? This is his songwriting . Other-worldy and quite a marvel . `` Deserted Cities of the Heart '' has a little of this added as well . Ginger Baker adds his unusual `` Pressed Rat and Warthog '' ( a talky piece with horns even alternately between two chords ! ) . But , recovers and proves himself with `` Those Were the Days '' . The best Jack Bruce tune not written by Jack Bruce.On part two we have his blues jam `` Traintime '' . Can almost imagine the train click-clacking along with this harmonica inspired number . We also have Ginger Baker 's wonderous drum solo again in `` Toad '' . Much better than the original studio recording , if you ask Metamorpho . `` Spoonful '' is much more precise and measured . A true joy . But , then we get to the `` core '' of exhileration . `` Crossroads '' , in itself , is worth the purchase of this classic c.d . Clapton 's lead transcends human boundaries ( and , when listened to loud , will bounce you off the walls ! Just as it has done to your beloved Seer since he listened to it many Seer moons ago ! ) . This , I feel , was the peak of Clapton 's power . Yes . He certainly has done many other excellent things ( `` Wonderful Tonight '' just does n't even compare to this ) . But , as raw live power- nothing rivals this , except Jimi at his finest . Take my word.In short ( ! ) a classic double album by one of the very best . And do remember that the cover ( which your Metamorpho has tried to embed himself in and has gotten bounced out each and every time ) reflected like sheer aluminum . How sad the times have compromised true value . But , you always have imagination . So says Metamorpho.Like to thank T and Johnny L for their support . After all , they are better than absent guides in the long run.So . That 's it . One more review and I 'm out of this Michigan farm . For Cream reviews , farm living is the place to stay- but I get allergic smelling hay . Ah . So it goes.To all who support Metamorpho-your check is in the mail.To those who don't-a check to the homeless shelter.Have fun ! Bossy packs a mean hoove lead ! -- -- -- -- -- Metamorpho", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "In September of 1978 , all four members of KISS simultaneously released solo albums .
