I had expected this to be a compact and smaller capacity version of Bissell 's full-sized Spotbot ( which is quite a nice machine by the way ) but sadly it is not.First of all , let 's address the spray system . While it does spray , it takes quite a number of sprays ( let 's call this heavy mist ) to saturate the stain area for effective scrubbing to be done by the brushes . Once the brushes get at the scrubbing and the cleaning solution dissolves the stains , this little unit is then supposed to vacuum it all up . While it does have enough suction to vacuum a couple of sprays ( aka heavy mist ) , it does not have enough suction to vacuum the amount of liquid that needs to be put on the stain in order to remove it . This futile attempt at suction is as if one tried to vacuum a glass of wine out of the carpet with a dust bunny handheld vacuum . One would have more luck with a silly straw in this aspect.The cumulative problem of holding this otherwise compact machine over a stain repeatedly misting it until properly saturated , waiting for the scrubbing action to do its thing and then for the insufficient suction to not work , is that the machine feels heavier and heavier to hold.The design solution to these drawbacks would simply be an adjustable spray output ( even a Windex bottle has one ) and increased suction power . The Bissell branded chemical cleaning solution and the scubbing brushes seem to do their job well enough.Usually when a pre-existing product is offered up for review in the Amazon Vine program , it means that the product has either been improved or re-marketed to a different segment ( pets for example ) . However , after doing some research , this product does not seem to have been re-marketed to a different segment nor has any of the pre-existing problems with weak spray and insufficient suction been addressed . However , I do not have nor received the original machine to compare this current machine to to determine if the spray or suction has improved over the older models from reviews a few months prior . If this machine `` is '' an improvement , my judgement is that it is still insufficient.For those that need a spot lifter , I do not recommend this particular machine . If Bissell 's full-sized Spotbot is in your price range , that machine delivers what this one does not . The Bissell cleaning chemicals are the same ( and are quite effective ) and it has an even better scrubbing system and lightweight handle.This machine was tested on a few pieces of cream-coloured carpet remnant with red wine stains , mud stains and pizza stains .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I would simply expect a blender to blend smoothies and crush ice , but this product does n't work well at either of those things .

Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain , but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie 's Choice : do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep , or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke ? So that 's why I bought this fan -- to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat . I have n't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet ( hopefully I wo n't NEED to *crosses fingers* ) but so far , I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility . It is nearly silent on the `` low '' settings , but when you set it on `` high , '' it moves a LOT of air . The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points -- it 's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because , when my partner is cooking , we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces . If we open up all the rooms , it helps a lot with cross-ventilation -- way more than the box fan we were using previously . In addition , our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter , and the exhaust function , when placed in a window near the radiator , helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here . Bonus ! Basically , it does everything I hoped it would do , and a couple of things I did n't even anticipate.I also love the way it 's shaped -- it fits nicely in the windowframe , and has a cute retro appeal . It 's front-heavy , but still quite easy to move . It 's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning , which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints , all of which are extremely minor : -I wish it were a little flatter , just because now we ca n't really close the indoor shutters on that window , but that 's an unusual situation ( most people probably do n't have those ! ) and I wo n't fault the design for it.-I 'm a little concerned about the switch -- it seems a bit flimsy and I 'm afraid it 'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm . But , so far , so good ! -while it 's pretty quiet , it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting . It 's a bit annoying , but if you 're more than a few feet away , you ca n't really hear it -- I 've used it while napping on the couch before and not found it distracting .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "If you want to get a bit fancy with your salad spinning , this is the one to buy .

I own a few heaters from DeLonghi , which we 've owned forever and love . These Holmes heaters were cheap and small and well rated , so I bought two of them ( in addition to some others ) this year . First I 'll say that 1 of the 2 does n't work at all . The red power light is on , but when you push any buttons , you can hear the fan/motor start up for about 1-2 seconds and it shuts itself off . There is simply something wrong , mechanically with the product , and I will have to return it . We have a chaotic household and i 'm a little peeved I 've got to go out of my way to box this , ship it and pay to return it to warranty - only to receive a refurbished one to replace it . It does n't seem worth it for $ 20 . That one , i 'm hoping was a fluke and not a common problem ( ? ) We have n't had that issue with the other one and it works *okay* but it is n't something I 'd recommend and if I had it to do over , I definately would n't purchase it . All of our heaters are small in size , but this does n't have much get-up-and-go to it . I think it puts out very little air and it does n't get terribly warm . I guess its just really wimpy . I was n't expecting something supurb for $ 20 , but we find we do n't even bother to pull it out.Additionally , the design is such , that it is much easier for things ( fingers and other foreign objects 2-6 year olds dream up to stick places ) to stick right through and into the fan blades . Again , my expectations are not extraordinary . Small children should n't really be near *anything* with a fan/motor/heating element ( not to mention foreign objects ; ) ) but our other heaters are designed much better , such that JUST in CASE a pencil or cat tail were to be inserted between the plastic shield over the fan makes it VERY challenging to hurt anything . In fact they 've either long-since given up or just never bothered . ( i do n't think i 'm allowed to mention the one we LOOVVE ) This would certainly work for someone that had small , simple needs for a very small space and noone in the household that would be inclined to put things places they do n't belong.Again , the other one never working , i 'm sure is a manuf/warranty issue .

The brushed stainless steel finish is just rough enough that flour will leave a thin film of dust on it and sugar will also partially coat the inside even though it is thoroughly cleaned and dried . This is n't enough that it is messing up the measurement , but it just bugs us because our other cups do n't do this.Conclusion : Not a bad set of cups .

Pros : quick , easy , no-brainer way to cook , at a very appealing price . Cleaning is easy : let it cool , then pour hot water over it and wipe down with some paper towels . The plastic cleaning utensil supplied is useless unless you use it while the grill is still quite hot , which puts you at risk of burning yourself.Cons : the drip tray needs to be bigger ... it can be pretty messy having to move the full one out of the way and put the empty one in place.If you are cooking more than one batch at a time , you will need to clean off the gunk on the grill in between batches , or else cooking time and evenness will suffer greatly.Despite its double-heating-surface design , the bottom surface is much hotter than the top surface , so you WILL need to flip your food , especially if you 're grilling anything thicker than say half an inch ( chicken breasts , steaks , etc . ) .The only way to achieve the nice browned/charred lines you see in the pictures is to apply addtional pressure to the grill from the top so that the meat will be pressed more tightly against the heating surfaces ... this was easy for me since I use it on my balcony floor , so I just put on ( shoed ) foot on top of it.There needs to be an on/off switch , so that you do n't have to plug/unplug the darn thing every time ... what a pain ! A `` ready '' light to tell you when the grill has been preheated enough would also be nice.The recommended cooking times on the cookbook were often way , way off ... which means you have to fiddle around for yourself.While food grilled this way is still much better than what you get from a microwave , and equal to a conventional oven , it still is not anywhere in the same class as a charcoal or gas-fired grill.In a nutshell : buy it for the price , speed and simplicity , but do n't expect much more than that .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I did n't bother coming here first because Amazon wo n't ship this attachment to Australia.Anyway , I finally got the thing the other day , after a lot of trials and tribulations , from a local store that was able to get it for me . And after all the effort and waiting to get it , what a huge letdown . I honestly expected more from KitchenAid.I have not used the grinder to grind - I did n't need a food grinder . I only purchased it to make pasta , and the plates are made to be used with the food grinder only.I have worked as a professional cook , have successfully made hundreds or maybe even thousands of kilos of from-scratch fresh pasta in my life , and have never come across such a reputable manufacturer offering such a poorly designed product as this . Shame on you , KitchenAid.For years , I 've used my little Italian hand-cranked pasta maker , and thought I 'd try this one because it would allow me to make tubular macaroni . I also thought the extrusion process would be easier than cranking . Not true.As others have said , getting the consistency just-so for extrusion is tricky . A couple of batches ended up in the rubbish.The object is to continue to drop walnut-sized pieces of dough into the tube , while also catching the pasta as it comes out of the machine . Because it tends to get warm and stick together in one huge blob , people on the KitchenAid boards have suggested sprinkling the emerging pasta with flour . And for this , you need three hands . Those of us lucky enough to have been born with three arms may find it a breeze , but the rest of us will struggle . And this is not even to mention the additional mess ( and wastage ) of the sprinkled flour ! By the time I was finished ( or rather , surrendered ) , the place looked like an explosion in a flour mill ! ) .The first disk I started with was the noodle disk , and then went to the lasagne disk.I ca n't see how the lasagne disk can be used for ravioli , as it has a `` join '' in tbe middle of the dough ( which can be seen as a transparent streak . This is because the dough is actully extruded from this disk in two pieces which join when they are dropping from the disk ) . I ca n't see that pasta holding up to being filled and boiled.The instruction booklet ( it was the European version ) was a letdown - only one recipe - `` Basic Egg Noodle dough '' . The recipe in English was in the `` home style '' volume measurement of cups , whereas the European measurements were in weight ( used by professional cooks , because it 's more precise ) . I used the European ones , except that was difficult to translate the names of the ingredients ( KA , please give us weight recipes along with the volume measurement ones , in English ) . I could n't believe that the KA website does n't have any recipes ! Do they really want to sell these things ? The instructions could have been clearer . I expected to drop a walnut-sized piece of dough into the machine , and have at least something come out . But the first piece is for the 'screw ' . It takes until the second piece and beyond , before you start seeing pasta . They could 've mentioned that , as I thought I was doing something wrong.I do not recommend spending money on this pasta maker ( the food grinder might be good . I have n't tried it ) . The only thing this purportedly does that my hand-cranked one does n't is tubular macaroni , and after seeing how it handled simple fettucine , I have my doubts about it ( also , the instructions said that macaroni could not be dried and kept , but had to be used within 4 hours of making , which may not always be practical ) . I 've decided that if I need macaroni , I 'll buy it ! The rest will be more than adequately handled by my dependable Atlas machine ( for which I now intend to get the add-on motor ) .Now , I think I 'll go to ebay and list this attachment , since I have no need for the grinder part , and the pasta function is pretty dismal .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "What a waste .

The fan surface measurement was done roughly 1/2 way up the fan blades right against the grill.On fan surface air velocity half-way up a blade at one point is , of course , just a sample point , and air velocity at a distance can be greatly affected by the degree of focus/dispersal .

That is , when comparing points where air velocities are roughly equal for the fans ( at the same distances ) , the loudness difference is so small I can hardly tell which is louder and the numbers support that.So there it is , my favorite three and some ways to compare them.SUMMARY : -- -- -- -- -- In the end these are just classic 20 '' box fans which are more similar than they are different . Hopefully whichever you choose wo n't be a lemon and will work for many years . Perhaps somewhere above you 'll find information you can use to choose the best fan to meet your needs.Whatever you get , if it rattles , shakes like crazy , makes an annoying hum , etc. , try exchanging it for another , do n't settle , there are less annoying fans out there and you 'll be listening to them for many years to come.I hope this helps someone : ) .SHOPPING NOTE : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Millions of 20 '' box fans are sold in the U.S. every year . Review sites can not get anywhere near a statistically valid user sample , so although we learn from comments about DEFECTS and EARLY FAILURE , I suggest not filtering out a model based entirely on them.There are also old reviews that have already been acted on by manufacturers to improve the product or fix a description , thus the review may no longer be accurate.That said , defect and early failure comments with details are great for FEEDBACK TO THE MANUFACTURER ( or author ) and to help us all much more quickly SPOT SIMILAR ISSUES and thus get an exchange while it is quick and easy to do .
