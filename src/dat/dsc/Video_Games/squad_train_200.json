And to be quite honest , playing Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be . Sure , the game is mildly entertaining , but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had , it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters . The character roster totals out at 17 , with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel . There are five modes of play including battle , versus , training , hero battle , and crossover . Battle and versus are your typical one- and two-player fighting game modes . Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters . Nothing special here . Crossover mode , however , is at least somewhat interesting . You see , in the original version of MSH vs. SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight . This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter but could n't make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation . Sadly , the tag team aspect of MSH vs. SF was also excluded for the same reason . Sure , you can still pick two characters , but you can only play as one of them . The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter . Crossover mode tries to bring the game 's main selling point home . This mode allows you to pick two characters , then the computer uses the same characters you picked . This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four . If you are victorious in this battle , the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another . This is done so that you are n't playing with and against the same two characters each fight . It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade , but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak . Visually , MSH vs. SF looks good . But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart , it simply fails . The colors are n't nearly as vibrant , and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown . It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter , though , because not nearly as much animation was cut out . This is a major plus , since frames of animation not only affect the game 's appearance but timing and gameplay as well.On the gameplay side , Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay . But in the end , it 's all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game . Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode , and with the overall exclusion of this mode , Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter game .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "This game is not receiving the credit it deserves .

Many puzzles , and 15 element types of Pokemon . Certain types are stronger against others , while each type has its weaknesses , too . There are a total of 150 Pokemon to be caught . However , some only appear in the Red version and some only in Blue . You must link to the Blue version to catch all 150 !

If you can get past the fact that the graphics are dated ( although remarkable considering the limitations they worked with ) and learn about the game in terms of gameplay alone , read on.First the basics : Mafia tells the story of Thomas Angelo as he joins the ranks of the Salieri 'famiglia ' and gains power within their ranks . The story -- which seems to be one of the selling points of the game -- is delivered through twenty multi-staged missions and in-engine cutscenes . The many interactive challenges in each mission are delivered through two distinct gameplay modes : driving and third-person exploration/combat.The third-person mode is the most versatile . From menial work to secret dealings to baseball bat beatings to all-out tommy-gun massacres , this is where the most action will come from . These segments can be pretty challenging : the AI does n't waste its chances . If you CAN get shot , you WILL get shot ; you , in the other hand , will leave lots of bullets in door thresholds as the game misrepresents your line of sight . It 's probably too preoccupied with cooking threats -- be it a couple of shotgun-toting goons out of nowhere or a well-placed shooter -- to bother with those pesky details , such as saving your progress . You 'll find yourself going back to square one quite time a few times as the game just decides that it 's not handing you any more ammo or health refills , and tough luck , here comes yet another trigger-happy batch , freshly teleported from Screwjoo.Every failure ( and there will plenty of them ) will set you back from twenty minutes to an hour of 'gameplay ' , and it wo n't spare you any of the mind-numbing chores that saturate the 'experience ' . You will have to go drive all the way there again , talk to guy A and guy B again , search for and fetch C for them ( most of the time without knowing precisely what you 're looking for or where to begin ) , and even load boxes into trucks and wipe out puke from a backed out toilet ... and it 's just as fun as it sounds.Not all of the game is made of tight spots and grunt work , though . You will be doing plenty of driving too : some missions involve vintage car chases ( which at 30 mph somehow fail to be the adrenaline pumpers you 'd expect ) , and the miniature city of Lost Haven is big and labyrinthine enough that most of your time will be spent traveling between points A and B . Going any significant distance in these roads ( which apparently were designed by M.C . Escher ) means a lot going around blocks and finding the entrance points of bridges and tunnels . You can try to cut corners , but policemen and cop cars will show up when least expected to punish you for running that red light or speeding . Lastly , there 's also a little circuit racing ; here , your main task will be not to engineer those sharp turns in a way that will keep you car from spinning like a top , which is harder than it sounds as the car seems to like it.That about sums it up . Oh , I forget : Mafia has been compared to the GTA titles , but in truth the resemblance is very superficial . It should be likened to the Sims -- Sure , you can roam about and steal another car and victimize random citizens , but it does n't reward wanton violence the way GTA did . No powerups , no better guns or cars , no cool stuff to be stolen ... fuggedaboutit.Veredict : Avoid like the plague . Unless you 're a masochist.What should have been a three-hour game was padded into a much larger but radically duller and more frustrating experience . What little genuine fun remained was irrecoverably marred by obtuse , artificial difficulty ( stiff controls , the savepoint system ) and brain-dead chores.Whether the team ran out of ideas five seconds after development began or they just hate gamers , I do n't know . I theorize that the positive reviews given to this game either a ) come from a time where much less was expected from games and b ) nobody dares tell the emperor that he 's naked .

Why ? Lets see Holy Highlighter 's standard breakdown : GRAPHICS : 2/10 - This game SORELY lacks , by any standards . While I was n't expecting it to rival high-end RPGs by high-end companies like Sony , Konami , and Square , this game 's graphics are remniscent of the earliest playstation games , and I thought developers had moved far beyond this . Blah ! Blah ! At least the FMV is decent.SOUND : 1/10 - Ok , the sound quality is just God awful . That , and the digimon sounds are really damn annoying , like the fact that a blaringly ugly sound is made every time a legless digimon & quot ; hops & quot ; . You would think that since this game would only become popular due to the TV show that they might have included the theme song ... but no , of course not ! CHARACTERS : 5/10 - The characters are decently developed , I suppose , and reflect the typical air-headed attitude of the TV show . The biggest gripe of most gamers is that none of the TV characters make an appearance ! What 's the point of having a Digimon game without any of the characters from the show ? Another fatal misstep on the part of the designers - most of the awesomely cool , powerful digimon from the show never show up . There is also very little control over which digimon your basic digimon evolves into , which annoys me greatly . The other annoying aspect is that every 2 hours of gameplay or so , your digimon dies and you have to start the process all ... over ... again.PLOT/STORYLINE : 2/10 - There is n't one . That 's all there is to say - the whole & quot ; lets bring digimon back to file city & quot ; crap is not plot , it 's a pathetic excuse . 99 % of the actions of the digimon do not revolve around the plot.SYSTEM/INTERFACE : 3/10 - The battle system is unique , which is the only plus this game has . In order to make your digimon even close to usable , you have to play an assortment of & quot ; minigames & quot ; , where you walk up to a sign , press a button , and lo-and-behold , your digimon gains stats . At first , I thought that letting the digimon participate longer in this game would make them gain more stat points - but it does n't matter , so basically more mindless button mashing is all that this thing does for you . Battling is 99 % of the game , and it gets boring relatively fast , especially since every 10 seconds or so you have to feed/clean up/immunize/rest your digimon . Even tamagotchi are n't this needy ! But there must be a positive thing somewhere , right ? Well , yes , the game is amusing for about an hour , before you realize that it 's just repetetive and does n't pass off as an RPG , or an action game , or anything else for that matter .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU COLLECT OLD GAME SYSTEMS .

First off , it has the longest install process of any game I have ever played , and I have a 48x CD-ROM drive . Second , the interface is monstrous , even though it looks elegant and simple . While positioning ships is easy , ( and it should be since they only move in 2 dimensions ) , there is no real sense of scale , plus they have a tendency to ` bump ' into objects like space stations and other ships . Secondly , the instant they see an enemy ship , any vessel you control within weapons ' range automatically opens fire , taking interaction down a notch . Also unlike Homeworld the user can not assign formations to his ships , making dispersement messy.When the game starts the user is treated to a rather nicely rendered opening scene with lots of fleet action between Federation , Klingon , Romulan and Borg vessels that culminates on an all-out run on Borg Cubes . ( Though one wonders how Picard can face down Locutus since they are the same guy . Did the Borg clone Picard ? ) Unfortunately , the game does n't deliver anywhere near the excitement generated by a 3 minute opening segue . At the title screen you have a choice to play a series of missions as either the Federation , Klingon , Romulan and Borg and they all must be played before arriving at the finale mission . Overall , the game seems to have been slapped together to capitalize on the franchise , lacking both the quality and substance that LucasArts has put into their Star Wars line of games . Armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like Homeworld or even Starcraft . If you changed the space scapes to ground and the starships to Zerg or Protoss units , Armada would be Starcraft , except not as much fun.Armada prolongs the Star Trek game curse when it should have shattered it . The prospect of moving a fleet of Defiant and Sovereign class starships around the screen should have been an easy game to create . Perhaps if Activision had optioned the Homeworld engine for Armada , things would have been different . However , on the upside , the rendered starships do look nice , as does the 3D lighting for all of the effects shots . Getting Patrick Stewart , Michael Dorn , and Denise Crosby to do voices will probably get die-hard Trek fans to purchase the game to feed their pirana-like frenzy for franchise merchandise , but style should never win out over substance in a game like this .

One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history , second only to that of Mario and Bowser . You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man . Along the way , you will fight many monsters , explore dungeons and temples , rescue a horse ( great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly ) , engage in numerous side quests and mini-games , learn many different tunes for your Ocarina , pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items , meet some gorgeous fairies , and in short , have a wonderful gaming experience.As with the other Zelda games , this one is filled with different puzzles of various types , most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game . They are engaging , but not too difficult to figure out , for the most part . There are a few , though , that I had a tough time with . Not to fear , though , there is plenty of help out there , both in books and on the internet , to aid you through those difficult spots . The controls are wonderfully intuitive . Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 ( and the game does , at times , suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did ) , and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself.The Z-targeting system is excellent , once you get used to it . You do n't really need it for some of the early monsters , but by the time you become an adult , it will be essential . In addition , you have a little fairy buddy , Navi , who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task . Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game.As I mentioned before , there are a number of side quests throughout the game . They 're not essential to finish the game , but they are a lot of fun , and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier . One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia , be sure and talk to the two scarecrows ! Later in the game , you will be glad you did . Also , be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars . They have many useful items , but they are also VERY expensive , and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game . Also , be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword . Do n't say I did n't warn you ... Although you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game , your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one . The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area , which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule . These secret areas contain goodies that you really do n't want to miss out on.All in all , an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect .

They finally succeded ( so to speak , if that was their actual intent ) when they started the SmackDown ! series . I have no problems with the graphics , the entrances , or the sound in this game . I have the biggest problem however with the gameplay and how the game controls.First off , they gave the game arcade style feel and controls . Big mistake . They also made it more like the actual show : you have to continually punch the guy before you can start doing grappling moves . I may be in the minority , but constantly punching a guy gets old fast . I want to be able to start throwing suplexes and hitting piledrivers right off the bat . Secondly , the game 's A.I . has gotten extremely intelligent . Too intelligent . The game can kick your ass unless you 're a great gamer , and I 'm just average , maybe a little below . Mainly because of the counter system . The game goes like this : punch , punch , punch , punch , grapple , move-counter move-counter move , etc . You 'll get countered excessively , and your counters wo n't work most of the time . Yes , it is a lot like the actual wrestling you watch on TV , but for a wrestling game to be fun in my opinion , it ca n't be realistic in terms of following how an actual wrestling match would go . I do n't want to spend over an hour or more in a match , 15-30 minutes is plenty , unless it 's a Royal Rumble-type match.THQ threw out the window the great grappling engine they had with the N64 games and has replaced it with this tripe . I honestly do n't understand what the fans see in this series of game . I guess if you like your matches in the game to follow how the matches on the show work , and you enjoy the actual wrestling to a be a chore and full of non-stop punching and countering , than this is the game for you . If you want an actual FUN wrestling game , then I suggest you stick with THQ 's WCW games on the N64 .

It 's so bad it 's actually comical ! In fact , it 's even almost like it was intended to be that way ( although I 'm sure it was n't ) . The game has a storyline that makes minus zero sense . The way it starts is , Shaq is in Japan before a charity basketball game , and he comes to this karate dojo ( by the way , there is a bit of prominent Pepsi product placement [ how 's that for alliteration ? ] here ) , where an old man informs him that he ( Shaq , that is ) is the Magic One , and that he ( again , Shaq ) must go into another dimension to rescue some kid named Nezu . Then Shaq goes through this portal into the other dimension . The story begs multitudinous questions , and never answers a single one ( unless I 've missed or forgotten something , or more than one thing ) . Some examples : Just why is Shaq ( the `` Magic One '' ) the ONLY one who can rescue Nezu ? Why ca n't anyone else do it ? Why was Nezu kidnapped in the first place ? Why is there a portal to the other dimension inside the dojo ? How does the old man know that Shaq is the Magic One ( that is , the one who must rescue Nezu ) ? This next question does n't really have so much to do with the story , but just exactly how do you pronounce `` Nezu '' ? ( `` NEZ-oo '' ? `` NEE-zoo '' ? `` NAY-zoo '' ? ) If I tried to list all of the questions that the storyline ( and other things in the game ) make me ask , the list would probably go on for miles before I finished it !

I would n't say that the controls are that good , though . Your opponents are really bizarre -- - a catlady , a mummy ( who is the main bad guy ) , and assorted other weirdos . Before each match , you and your opponent engage in a bit of smack talking -- - bad smack talking , at that . It seems that your opponents all have much better moves than you do ; they can whip your butt in no time . I find it odd that Shaq has no basketball-related moves ; should n't he at least have the ability to throw basketballs at his opponents ? ( By the way , get a load of the mummy guy 's name : Sett Ra . Those who are familiar with ancient Egyptian deities , or at least their names , will probably get a laugh out of that . ) And , for those of you who may not want the ending of the game spoiled , SKIP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH ! The game ends as ridiculously as it begins ( almost ) . Shaq returns to Earth ( with Nezu ) in time for that charity basketball game -- - and who is there at the game but Shaq 's enemies from the other dimension ( or at least a couple of them , anyway ) . Then Shaq dishes out a little more smack talk , and that 's it.Overall , a supremely cheesy game . It really makes no sense that Shaq is even on the game . The game indeed appears to have been mainly just a cheap attempt to cash in on Shaq 's ( then- ) celebrity , as he was very big at the time ; making a truly good game ( let alone one where Shaq 's presence actually makes sense ) does n't seem to have been a priority . If you like games with storylines that make actual sense ( any sense at all ) , this definitely is n't one of those games . If you like games that play really well , this is n't one of those games , either . But if you just want a game that is good for a few laughs ( even if that was unintentional ) , this game might work for you , though it certainly is n't worth paying much for .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "You ca n't go wrong with this game .

In terms of adventure PC gaming , however , `` Myst '' is utterly without equal and ( if you are the right kind of person ) will quickly become one of the most endearing experiences of all your entertainment pastimes.Before `` Myst '' , computer gaming usually was in the form of either first-person shooters ( `` Wolfenstein '' ) , adventures aimed more towards children ( `` Kings Quest '' ) , and the tons and tons of shareware/pong/simulator games that flooded the market in the early-to-mid 1990s . In `` Myst '' , though , gamers are simple dropped into an environment where little to no information is given to them , thus requiring much exploring and a logical mind to determine not only the overall point of the game , but also how all the levers and puzzles work in conjunction with each other.For a basic plot summary , you ( `` the Stranger '' ) suddenly appear in a universe where a man named Atrus can pen books that actually spring to life . However , many of his worlds are dying/unstable and you must determine the cause . Is it Atrus himself who has gone mad and imprisoned his sons in his own prison books , or are the sons locked away for good reason ? The `` Stranger '' must explore a series of five islands and piece together the mystery one puzzle and logical deduction at a time.This Myst series is not for everyone , by any means . If you are a bit lacking in patience and want a lot of action , this is not the game for you . It can get a bit tedious at times and one has to resist ( especially nowadays when walk-throughs are available with a few mouse clicks ) the urge to look up hints all the time ( as that truly destroys the beauty of the experience ) , so if you want to be blasting baddies or wreaking war/havoc , look elsewhere are the risk of severe disappointment.For those who really appreciate this kind of `` thinking-person 's '' game , `` Myst '' is unrivaled ( and I have tried MANY of its subsequent clones ) in the industry because of its riveting storyline . A lot of other games have tried to duplicate the `` puzzling '' style of `` Myst '' , but only `` Myst '' has been able to successfully capture the emotion of compelling characters that never seem to get old.Overall , I consider `` Myst '' to be one of my all-time favorite PC games because of its groundbreaking intuitive style . In hindsight , at least two of its sequels surpass this original , but `` Myst '' is always special because it set the groundwork for the master series . If you want your brain/wits to be more involved in a PC game than your trigger finger , then I strongly recommend `` Myst '' if you have n't tried it to this point .

The AI wo n't link consequences to actions so you punish or reward actions regardless of their consequences.The game is very unhelpful .

It does n't really matter if you save or load your game , your & quot ; creature 's personality & quot ; is persistent .

But this underscores the point . The fan community has to rush in to save a game that is too restricting and too deceiving . There is nothing going on under the hood of this & quot ; game & quot ; .

Some people memorize hotkeys , others do n't . This is easy and intuitive , with a helpful legend in the lower right hand corner so you remember that moving the cursor in a swirl brings up the spell you want , etc.One innovation for a truly pathetic game .

Final Fantasy 3 on the SNES , was a great success . Many magazines like GamePro and EGM have praised it for its rich plot and complex scenarios . Nintendo Power even called it `` the RPG hit of the decade . '' Fans of the Super Nintendo and RPGs rejoiced over how great this game was , and with a slew of other RPGs on the system like Chrono Trigger , ActRaiser , and Nintendo 's A Link to the Past , a lot of fans -- -myself included -- -generally regard this period as one of the best video game production times of our generation , if not THE best.Along comes the Sony PlayStation . For some , this marks the end of the Golden Age of classic video games . I do n't entirely agree , as that system was the home of a handful classics ; Castlevania : Symphony of the Night revitalized the Castlevania series and outranked many of the 3-D games that cropped up at the time . Metal Gear Solid redefined stealth action and brought Solid Snake into the mainstream . Mega Man X4 continued the saga of Mega Man X and combined the old-school flavor of Mega Man with arcade-style , frenetic action.Now , we get into Final Fantasy 7 . The first game , besides the original , to be correctly numbered . If you 've read my FF6 review , I said that that game was the end of the magic era and the introduction of industrial technology . FF7 takes that further into a dystopian technological atmosphere ; its bleak , dark outlook is not dissimilar to Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner . This was a stark contrast to the previous games that were about grandiose medieval adventure . No more dragons , colorful highlands , and sorcery . No more saving the princess from mortal doom . No more four crystals and light warriors.When I first played this game back in 1997 , my first thought was `` This is n't Final Fantasy ! I mean , they curse in the game , too ! How dare they change my Final Fantasy ? ! How dare they take away what I loved about it ? ! '' Yet , many of my friends loved it , and still love it for its nostalgic factor . Heck , it 's sold over ten million copies worldwide , making it the highest-selling Final Fantasy of ALL time.Coming from that stubborn mold , I did n't give the game an objective eye and realized years later that I initally rejected it under a false pretense . Is it my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time ? Well , no , but I am giving it its credit now , and there are many aspects of the game that help make it the top-selling Final Fantasy game.The story centers on a former SOLDIER named Cloud Strife , who joins the AVALANCHE group in trying to take down Shinra , Inc. , a megolomaniacal corporation that 's draining the planet 's life force . He 's a bit less colorful than some of the main characters of past Final Fantasies ( even further games ) , but through the course of the game , he has a very interesting backstory . He is joined by Barrett , the leader of AVALANCHE and the closest video game character akin to Mr. T ; Tifa Lockhart , a sexy martial artist and friend of Cloud 's ; Aeris , a flower merchant who turns out to be a `` Cetra , '' the previous owners of the planet ; Red XIII , a cat creature that was experimented on by Shinra ; Cid Highwind , a pilot with Dragoon Knight characteristics ( and ironically , shares the same last name as Kain from Final Fantasy 4 ! What delight ! ) ; Vincent , an immortal that previously worked with Shinra before his `` death '' ... and Yuffie , a young thief who plays tricks on the party . Oh , and then there 's Cait Sith , but let 's move on ... The villain that everyone talks about from this game is Sephiroth . In my FF6 review , I thought Kefka was the best Final Fantasy villain ever . I still believe that , but Sephiroth is still one of the greatest villains in any RPG . Sephiroth does have some interesting motives ; he is originally Cloud 's friend , even a mentor , and the best member of SOLDIER for a time . However , upon learning what appeared to be his real past ( not quite real , but no spoilers here ! ) , he progressively goes insane and is hell bent on bringing back the `` Promised Land , '' which basically means wounding the planet and sucking its life force . While he 's not your typical , heartless villain ( not saying Kefka is typical , but you feel from the first hour of that game that he is downright evil . ) , he is a mentally distraught , horribly twisted person , and that progression of madness that worsens throughout the game is actually very well transitioned . Plus , he is responsible for murdering Aeris , scarring the mind of my RPG generation forever.While the battle system only allows three people , the Materia system and the Limit Breaks add fun to the game . While I adore Final Fantasy 9 , 7 's Limit Breaks worked better , and they also level up . The Materia system is based on your weapons and items ' slots , allowing you to interchange materia like ice , fire , lightning , restore , and other things . They also do things differently depending on how they 're linked to other materia and ALSO if they 're attached to your weapon or your accessory . This adds some fun to the battle , and you can even interchange materia without disrupting the level of the particular materia slot you 're using.The story is as epic as any great Final Fantasy should be , although I do admit that the ending is a bit lax ... still , it was followed up by sequels , so at least the story did continue . Most of the characters are interesting , even colorful ( Cid and Barrett 's constant swearing definitely added flavor to this FF entry ! ) . Cloud 's complex relationships with Aeris and Tifa are among the story 's highlights , and of course , the culmination of Cloud facing his former friend and idol.The music is once again composed by Nobou Uematsu , and he delivers once again . My ONLY complaint is not with his compositions itself , but with the sound quality . The Sony PlayStation had a superior sound chip system in comparison to the Super NES , yet the sound quality of games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 ( er , 6 ! ) blasted you with superb sound quality . I do n't hold this against the game to any large degree , but I did find that kind of odd ... especially if you hear Michiru Yamane 's score for Symphony of the Night or Toshihiko Horiyama 's score for Mega Man X4.Overall , my final opinion of the game . I 've grown to like this game despite my love for the more medieval-styled Final Fantasies of the past . This one was a departure from the past , adding more mature elements into the game ( colorful language , sexual references , etc . etc. ) . Definitely your big brother 's kind of RPG . While some may dispute its `` overrated '' longevity , its success on the Sony PlayStation became a part of that system 's legacy and it also brought RPGs to the mainstream audience.Yes , it 's insanely popular , but give the game its due . It 's worthy of the qualities that have made it the best-selling Final Fantasy , and while it may not be my personal favorite , it kicks major amounts of awesome nonetheless.Other Recommendations : Final Fantasy 6 ( in my opinion , perfectly accompanies this game ) Chrono Trigger ( SNES ) Breath of Fires 2 and 3 ( SNES , PSX ) Xenogears ( PSX ) Castlevania Symphony of the Night ( PSX )", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "not sure if it was this one or the other one , order for my son , only had one disc was suppoed to have 2 , he rented from the library and it had 2", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "To get the bad out of the way , this game is slow , tedious , and & quot ; tactics & quot ; simply is not a good way to describe it . There is very little tactical combat involved . Moves happen immediately as soon as you choose an action . There are no attacks that change the position of enemies , so a very large amount of the game is luck regarding the position of your enemies to allow you to cast wide-range spells that will annihilate everything . Adding to the bad is the downright broken leveling system . Essentially it works like this : Perform an action , get experience and job points . Regardless of what action you perform . This ends up making you enter a random battle , killing all except one enemy , and throwing rocks at each other for an hour until you all have leveled up obscenely , and can essentially learn any skill now . Not very fun . The story is also pretty pathetic , the translation makes the game very difficult to understand , and the story itself does n't stand out among other RPGs . Personally , I do n't care for the whole medieval politics setup , but it might please some . The good ? There are a whole lot of skills and classes to learn and be , and the idea of being able to equip TWO job skills at once makes for some pre-battle strategy .

Everquest is just what it says , a quest that just keeps going and going , now I know this may sound fun at first , but keep reading . after playing my character to lvl 19 ( takes forever , 2 - 3 months ) I finally realised that the game is not changing , it never gets harder , its always the same , every enviroment is modeled after another , only changed a bit , the monsters are uninspired and it takes forever to get up lvls , as you can see above , ( for those of you who do n't know , a lvl is what you gain after getting enough experiance [ which is what you get when you kill a monster ] to surpase a limit which gains you a lvl and makes you better at fighting monsters . ) The monsters have terrible AI ( artificial inteligence ) they wander about the world until you or someone comes into view , then they attack you ! there is no AI in this game , a lvl 1 orc pawn will attack a lvl 20 warrior ! How stupid is that ? Does the pawn give any consideration to your supiriority ? No , it is simply programed to attack whatever comes into view . The only thing that gets harder about EQ as you go along is how long it takes to get lvls . It can take you as much as 6 months to a year before you get up to lvl 50 ( the highest lvl you can obtain ) . Another thing is the price , which ALL online RPG 's charge , you pay $ 40 - $ 50 to buy the game at the store , but it doesnt stop there , you have to pay 9.95 a month to continue playing . Now , if you have to pay $ 9.95 a month , why do they make you pay $ 50 to buy the game ? they should make it $ 20 to buy the game , and they should lower the price of the monthly cost as the game gets old , but they do n't , so you 'll end up paying a ridiculous price for everything and in the end , realise it was n't worth it .

Those of you who have played Mario Party 8 or 9 for the Wii can now see the humble beginnings of this popular series of hit family games.Unlike Mario Party 8 , there is a somewhat more interesting storyline where the six most famous characters of the Mushroom Kingdom ( Mario , Luigi , Peach , Yoshi , DK , and Wario ) are arguing over who could be the Super Star . After a rather amusing argument sequence , the six are placated by Toad to play a variety of games in order to achieve good deeds and become the Super Star.When held in comparison of the boards of Mario Party 8 and 9 for the Wii , the boards of Mario Party 1 are still holding up well . Naturally , the graphics are incredibly dated , but the design is a tad more intricate and focuses on gameplay instead of the visual style . The rules are the same for each board also : - You and three other players move around the board in a predetermined amount of turns- Play addictive and fun mini-games- Collect coins and ( hopefully ) a star or two- Try not to run into Bowser who will cause nothing more but trouble and steal your money or stars- And after each amount of turns play out , you get a cool little cinema of victory if you win.While I consider Mario Party 8 visually better and more entertaining , this game is still a classic and not just because it started the Mario Party craze . I love this game because the music is very cool compared to the strange pieces played in 8 and the controls are much more easier to use than the erratic unpredictability of the Wii-Remotes .

It takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth , fun , and challenging adventure . You assume the role of James Bond , the secret agent who needs no introduction . You run through various missions , which tie into the movie , and solve various problems and perform various tasks . What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight . As expected , you have a number of weapons at your disposal , from the silenced pistol and machine gun , to the grenade launchers and high-powered explosives . The first-person perspective adds amazing realism to this game , with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bond 's charm.The graphics are phenominal , with smooth movements and amazing scenery . This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures . The music is right out of a Bond movie , and adds a nice edge to the action . The controls , usually quite clunky on that horrible N64 controller , are easy to manage here .

Superman must go save his friends and the world from the evil deeds of Lex . This game feels like a Pilotwings/Beat 'em up/Find the button game.GRAPHICS : The people who gave this game 5-star reviews said the graphics are amazing . Are they ? Why yes , if you think a game that looks like a PSone game made on a budget of $ 10 or it looks someone vomited Fruity Pebbles all over the TV screen , then yes it does look fantastic . Absolutely mind-blowing especially with the numerous glitches in the environments . The programming work done by Titus is stunning indeed . Superman can go through walls unexpectedly or can stuck in random places and will be unable to move for a brief period of time . Wow , Titus ! MUSIC : The musical score is truly amazing . It 's the kind of musical score that makes a person want to drown some kittens when they hear it . I want this composer 's hand then slap them across the face and tell them , `` Wow , way to suck ! `` SOUND : The sound effects seem like they were recorded in a basement . Everything is too quiet or it echoes . Another accomplished feat for the guys who made this game . Even something as simple as sound effects suck.GAMEPLAY : During my playthrough of the game this is how the missions went ; Fly through the rings ! Pick up those cars before those people get crushed ! Fly through more rings ! Pick up that police car and take it to the other side of the road ! Fly through more rings ! Beat those four thugs armed with guns ! Fly through more rings ! Use your ice breath to stop those tornadoes from sucking up those people ! Fly though more rings ! Go into a building ! Beat up robots and find a keycard ! Insert keycard then go to an elevator to another with even more robots to beat up ! Destroy those robots , open those doors , and rescue those people underground ! Go disarm bombs , and along the way beat up more robots , a tank , and a woman who has better skills than you do ! The repetition goes on and on and on . This game is very repetitive . Extremely repetitive to be exact . And very broken too . Overall , this game plays out like Pilotwings , except you break the controls , and the make the dated visuals even worse.OVERALL : If you enjoy life and do n't wish to pollute the classic N64 stay away from this horrible game .

Games like Golden-Eye 64 , The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time , Super Mario 64 , and Banjo- Kazooie . Memories like getting my fore-head shot by my brother , grabbing my 120th power star , and meeting Princess Zelda for the first time.Donkey Kong 64 does n't come up in any of these if you have n't noticed by now , and for good reason . It 's slow , pokey , and not really all that fun . Which is really a problem after the success of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.THE GRAPHICS : Donkey Kong 64 seems to take the graphics roll from Super Mario 64 , in that the characters are a little on the blocky side , but their really not all bad . I 've only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description : In one area , the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the character 's face on it . Sounds fine right ? Wrong , the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas . A metal switch attached to a wooden chest . Sheer laziness . VERDICT : *** 3/5THE STORY : Quite simple really , Donkey 's horde of bananas have been stolen once again by King K. Rool , ruler of the Kremling reptiles . He 's also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other Kongs in cells mapped around the game . The game introduces many new character like Lanky Kong and the banana fairies , along with some pretty whacked up levels . It 's not really all that original , but it works.THE VERDICT : *** 3/5THE GAME-PLAY : This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills , and not in the good way . The game rips from the popular `` grab the golden item to proceed to more levels '' style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie . Now , that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years , but DK64 has you `` power-walking '' your way through each task , some of which are dragged on already.It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose ( except the first level ) . The game is loaded with long hallways , ledges you need to slowly climb , and slow frame-rate issues at times . If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster , I probably would n't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother 's room so he could sleep . Oh yeah , and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction . This game ruins hands , and sleepy little brothers . THE VERDICT : * 1/5THE MUSIC : The game ranges from toy factories , jungles , pyramids and the like , so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across . Some of the music is pretty catchy , but I did n't find myself dazzled by any means . I found myself humming 2 or 3 songs , but that was it , none of which you 'll be hearing very often . The sound-effects are fitting and pretty original . Thanks to this game every time I see an orange , I immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game . Pretty funny right ? VERDICT : *** 3/5OVERALL : DK64 had a lot of hype , and it 's a shame it did n't turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the Donkey Kong County , Battletoads , and Jet Force Gemini series , which were excellent gems . I played this game as a kid years ago and completed everything in the game , I really must have exaggerated greatly how fun it was back then , because I ca n't seem to have any courage to attempt getting everything in just level 4 . While the music is descent , the graphics okay and the story shallowly good , none of those elements are what make you play a game . You play to have fun , to enjoy the universe of the characters , and to enhance you skills . I 'd be able to accomplish all those things twice as much just eating a banana and watching my dad trim his nails than playing Donkey Kong 64.OOOOH BANANA.OVERALL VERDICT : ** 2/5", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Perhaps I 'm just not enough of & quot ; hard core & quot ; gamer , but I foudn this game too difficult to be enjoyable .

Now a lot of reviews do a great job of summing up the flaws of this game , bad running system , very short game , super linear , etc . Here 's my ultimate beef with Parasite Eve . It fails to be a worthy RPG and lacks cunning elements to be a decent horror game . I ordered French Toast with hot maple syrup and sausage on the side and what do I get ? A dry lukewarm bowl of oatmeal and no milk . BleH ! My Other Beefs With Parasite Eve 's : -Cut scenes before boss battles . Anyone who likes RPG 's knows how utterly frustrating it can be having to watch the same cinematic before a hard boss fight.-Bad weapon system . Why use a rocket launcher when you can upgrade a pistol to do just as much damage as well as make you act faster in battle ? Whoever was assigned to work on this part of the game was in my opinion lazy.-Two discs only 14 hours of gameplay . What ? ? Already mentioned in other posts too.-Linear , Linear , LinEAR ! ! ! Ok not Final Fantasy 13 Linear , but close to it.-Boring story . Think of a corny Scifi movie and there you have it . Nothing new or exciting . If anything the story borrows on Resident Evil and tries to mix in it 's own thing . Whatever that is because I totally missed it . Same old , same old.-Adding techno music to a game is n't a great idea if you 're going for horror . It 's catchy , but destroys the mood when you 're in a dark hall and there 's creepy ambient noise . Then all of a sudden Pu-ch Pu-ch Pu-ch , *surrounded my monster.-Sad last boss battle . It 's a fairly easy win , but here 's the catch . After the battle you have to run from the creature through a ship . Think Resident Evil 6 Ada story , but if you take a wrong turn and it catches you guess what ? Game over start over from last save point . Only your last save point was before the 10 minute cut scene before the boss and the 10 minute boss fight . So after all the failed attempts just to run from the boss you 're looking at a 3 hour last boss battle due to failing to run away from it. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Now Parasite Eve does have good graphics for its time and a very nice soundtrack with some catchy tunes . Is this enough to make it a great game ? In this case no ... Ahem ... check please . It 's just lacking way too much to be worth while as many others have already mentioned here on Amazon and does n't really pull out anything unique.Also on a side note if you 're a Christian I highly recommend skipping this one as it manages to drop the name `` Jesus '' twice in the first five minutes of game play . Then four minutes later you find a journal that mentions the bad guy wanting to `` sell their soul to the devil . '' Mix that in with a bunch of `` Hells '' and `` God '' throughout the whole game.I bring this up because I 've played a lot of RPG 's in my time . I mean A LOT . And it 's very uncommon for stuff like this to be said in a Fantasy game , especially on this level . Poor choice of dialogue , the guy who translated this to English should have been fired . I 'm sure you wont find this type of dialogue in the original Japanese translation.It 's games like Parasite Eve that make me ask `` Why . '' Why do n't I have millions of dollars to make a game to show them how it 's done . That would be great , but I do n't . So I 'm stuck just throwing in my two cents on how and how not to make a game . *sighAnywho , all is not lost . If you 're looking for a classic RPG that 's worth while why not check out -Vagrant Story- or -Threads Of Fate- . A few months back I played -Vagrant Story- and it was actually pretty decent .

The story was flawless and breathtaking then , and yet , somehow , it all seems better this time around . What makes Lunar Lunar though is the fact that Working Designs was behind it . They can translate even the lamest games and make them playable ( I even bought Shining Wisdom for my Saturn just because of Working Designs ! ) . The people at Working Designs are a bunch of comedians . There are so many jokes in this game it 's unbelievable ( second only to Final Fantasy IX in humor ) . The game has received an upgrade in every single way , most notably , the graphics . Yes , the graphics are n't an important part of any game , but it 's nice to see that they got an uplift this time around . Back to the story though . Everything about the story is perfect , it 's beautiful , it 's touching , and it 's one of the best in any game I have ever seen . I could go into more detail ... but you should really play it for yourself . What surprised me about playing Lunar again was the length of the game . It 's pretty long . While not as long as its sequel , it still offers days of fun like I had with the original version . The characters themselves are great . Typical of their RPG times ? Yes , but great nonetheless . Especially Alex and Nall , who I just loved . The difficulty of the game is very applaudable as well . Not incredibly difficult , but it 's not easy either , and that 's just another reason why I love this game so much . The one thing that did n't stand the test of time was the battles . They 're very straight-forward and basic , nothing to it at all . It 's just tap ... tap ... tap . Boring indeed . Thankfully the random number of battles is n't frequent . The packaging also needs mention . Lunar : SSSC comes with a nice box that contains a 100+ page leatherette hardbound artbook/instruction manual , a making of Lunar CD , a music CD , and a full-color cloth map . Who loves ya ? Working Designs ! Unfortunately , new-school gamers might be put off by Lunar 's old-school look and feel continuously asking & quot ; Where 's Bahamut Zero ? & quot ; This is unfortunate because it looks like Lunar might go back to the cult status it had on the Sega CD instead of selling by the truckloads like it deserves . Oh well ... definitely their loss . Nevertheless , this is a masterpiece . Lunar : SSSC should be as mandatory as the controller for PSX owners .

The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge , get this . I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels , ( I 'm not sure of this ) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure .

I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes . There is n't much of a story to this game but for me , that 's okay . But for serious gamers ( I think I am but this game is so good that I do n't really care about the story ) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story . There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time . The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out ( no cheats no guide no nothing ) . There are two charaters to chose from . Reinhart and a girl ( I forgot her name ) . Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things . I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon . The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up . I do n't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you , you have to charge . She also has these two ... .rings they look like . She uses that to slice things , just like Reinhart 's sword . There are two modes you can go through . Easy and Normal . Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy . There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff . As I mentioned before , their is n't much of a storyline but when you start the game , there is some .

Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game , this still is a great game . The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards , the controls are tight , the sounds are good and the music is very catchy . This game also uses great ideas , such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky ( but really enjoyable ) courses . In fact , some of the courses have no snow on them ! But that 's the fun of this game : getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain , while at the same time , hitting your opponents with pie-pans , bombs , rocks and other items . It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just ca n't explain . But it 's not all fun and games though . There are some problems . First , is the game 's image . Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game , though I liked it so much , I did n't care . The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data . The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak , you 'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also ( Mystical Ninja starring Goemon , Rugrats In Paris ) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping ( Wave Race 64 , Perfect Dark ) . But even with these issues , the game is still really fun and worth playing . If you like it and still want more , try its sequel , Snowboard Kids 2 .

Somehow it just would n't die , no matter how hard we tried.At first , it just seemed so standard and bland . Playing muliplayer for the first time , I had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the Temple level . soon , somehow , something clicked , and me and my friends ended up playing it for about 4 hours straight . Towards the end of that introductory marathon Goldeneye session , we took our first stride out of the standard Deathmatch restriction- increasing my character 's health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me . Thus we coined the & quot ; God & quot ; mode , and we played this variant to death in the coming months.It did n't end there . We had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches . We bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen , LAN-type mode , covering up other player 's screens so we would n't know where the other players were . We playedthe Team mode constantly , refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship . Fed up with auto-aiming , we turned it off and further honed our skills . I began to be able to play the Complex level in my sleep . Proximity mines soon became an addiction . We pushed the game to its limits , learning that we could move the ammo boxes , shields , and guns around by shooting them , thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games . We began to use Gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that were n't intended for the final version , as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players . We discovered a code that turned one player invisible , and proceeded to do hunter-hunted scenarios over splitscreen.Basically , it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities . It was a revolution for first-person shooters , and so many have overlooked this fact . It was the first to have targeting of individual body parts , over 20 weapons to choose from , realistic glass , shooting out of lights , and bullet holes , and for its time fairly revolutionary AI .

Once you finish that level , which dissapointingly is very short , you can save the game . But , not all the levels have this bonus level , which makes it really hard . You have to get through a few levels in some cases to get to a bonus level . And the thing is , each time you load the game , it starts out with four lives , no matter how many you had when you saved . So that makes it really hard . What you have tio do is play the levels in the beginning to rack up lives . But get this : once you play the level once and collect all the lives , you can not collect many more . If you play it again , you will not be able to get as many lives as before . The boxes normally filled with lives are now just filled with fruit . Collect 100 and get another life .

The concept . I love the concept . Making an adventure out of a racing game , and the format they gave it is an excellent idea . The sheer number of tracks is exhilarating . And on some courses there are THREE ( plane , hovercraft , kart ) types of vehicles to use . It is just a tragedy that in practice it does n't come off at all . It is nowhere near Super Mario Kart 64 . That game is fast-paced and loads of fun , the best racer to hit the N64 . Size wise , this dwarves Mario Kart 64 . If they could have had the execution on Mario Kart 64 and the concept of Diddy Kong Racing , we would have had one hell of a game . Sadly , such a game does not exist ( yet ) . We have to settle with a badly executed game ( Diddy Kong Racing ) with another racing game that is superb in all manner of ways . But , with a little engineering , we could have the best of both worlds . Super Mario Kart 64 is the way to go , folks . The multiplayer battle is really fun too , especially Block Fort . Superiour in concept , inferiour in execution .

It also does n't eat an entire memory card like NFL 2K -- just a little over half of one.The bad news , though , is that there are some INCREDIBLY big problems with gameplay . Number one : FIELDING FIELDING FIELDING . The worst are grounders through the & quot ; gap & quot ; between first and second . The first baseman is apparently unable to move even three feet to his right in order to snag the ball . Ugly.Number two : baserunning . How many major-leaguers have *you* seen running on an infield popup with less than two out ? Play this game at all , and you 'll see guys who get paid more than the GNP of some small countries making that very same bonehead move . The player has to physically remind his baserunners to return to base on a pop-fly.These two very large problems are enough to really take a lot of the enjoyment out of what would otherwise be a very good game.There are some other problems , too : the little graphic that shows where the ball ( tiny white pixel ) , defensive players ( tiny blue pixels ) and runners ( tiny yellow pixel that is nearly indistinguishable from the ball ) is almost completely useless . The fans in the stands look like something out of a Nintendo 64 game . There 's no way to skip past the incredibly awful renditions of the national anthem at the beginning of each game . The replays are n't very interesting . The commentary is wooden and nowhere near as well-done as in , say , one of the excellent NFL games . The controls are not always very intuitive or responsive ( especially irritating when you 're frantically pressing B to get your idiot baserunners to return to base while they blithely jog along , finally realizing that Oh ! You want them to DO something ! ) . These are all pretty petty little quibbles , really , and none of them would be enough to really make this a bad game by themselves , but when combined with the fielding and baserunning problems , the annoyances just mount and mount until you want to chuck your controller at the TV .

The weaknesses/strengths with this sequel are as follows : Story & amp ; Characters : No connection is made to Chrono Trigger until well into the game , also very few characters from the original CT are mentioned , or shown . Espeically the sorceror Magus ( you do see a passing mention to his real name in a letter to Kid , thats it , o and he may be one of two guys in the game ) , not too mention they got his sister Schala 's face structure and skin color ALL wrong at the end . Also the first ending is quite weak and dumb.The 40 character roster is ridiculous , having this many characters stresses quantity rather than quality . Many of the 40+ characters have no personality ( besides an accent or odd way of speaking ) or story or plot threads behind them . Most of the characters in this game have no individuality.The sory is somewhat confusing ( as well as the two Dimensions , see below ) as its hard to keep straight what happens between the two nearly-identical worlds.On Dimensional Travel : The dimensional travel back and forth between worlds would of been great , that is if Square would of put at least a little bit of distinction between the two worlds so they do not look nearly identical ( perhaps give different continental shapes as in the first CT ) . This adds for a lot of confusion when you are completing tasks when going back and forth between worlds.Levels & amp ; Magic : Instead of leveling up ( like in normal RPGs ) you gain stars for defeating bosses . So the game leaves you wondering if you ever got stronger at all or if you ever will . Also magic is not learned it is assigned by & quot ; color & quot ; . And this gives the game even more of a completist & quot ; pokemon & quot ; feel ( not too mention the 40+ characters ) by classifying the characters all by color , again ruining any chance of individuality between characters . About the only individuality characters have are different tech skills.Sound & amp ; Music : The opening , well-orchestrated theme & quot ; Scar Of Time & quot ; will blow you away . The other music in this game is very well done , some of it being slight remixes or remade versions of music in the original CT ( except this time its played with real instruments and not synthesized ) . There is one point in the game however where you will want to turn down the volume . Although accompanient lacks in some areas ( like the acoustic guitar themes ) the sound overall is great.Graphics & amp ; Animation : Absolutely breathtaking ! The animation for the spells during battle are well detailed and flow very smoothly , this section along with the sound are the game 's strong points.The game for a hardcore CT player ( I swear I played Chrono Trigger so much I had every detail memorized ) is somewhat below average . For one thing there are too many characters ( keeping it at 10 max would of been fine ) , secondly this game was developed to begin with not as a sequel to CT but rather for a Japanese Satellite System called BS where players in Japan can play together ( it was called Radical Dreamers back then ) , and many of the developers and designers said in interviews it is not a true CT sequel ( if we are lucky the loyal CT fans might see a real sequel , we can dream cant we ? ) .The bottom line is if you never played CT you 'll enjoy this game .

Its one of those game thats old , but never got boring even when I played it multiple times . For those who are new to the series , you might think its just running up to monkeys and catching them with a net . You 're partially right . If you go into this game and try to catch every monkey by just running up to them with your net , you will get a game over fast . I own the other 2 games in the Ape Escape series and played them multiple times , so its safe for me to say that Ape Escape 1 is the hardest of the series . Let me go into a little more detail.A little background : I 'm not sure about other consoles at the time , but the PS1 , unlike todays Sony consoles , had a different control scheme . Instead of using the analogue sticks to move your camera and control your character , you used the arrow buttons . The analogue sticks did n't have much use . Actually with some games no use at all . In other games like Spyro the Dragon you had the option to turn them on , but for some of those games it was glitchy . Ape Escape prooved revolutionary in that it was the first PS1 game to solely use analogue controls and I 'm happy it did . I think Ape Escape is the best moving ps1 game I have ever played due to analogue controls . It makes controlling your character and changing camera angles way easier than most games at the time . Now all games use this control scheme for the better.Story summary : 2 boys , Spike and Jake , are heading to the Professor 's laboritory to try out his time machine , but once they get there they find the professor and his assistant/granddaughter Natalie tied up by a horde of monkeys . The monkeys leader ( Spector ) has gotten hold of one of the professors inventions called the peak point helmet which increases Spectors intellegents and helps him achieve an insane level of power . The other monkeys possess Monkey helmets that do pretty much the same thing as Spectors helmet , but less powerful . Spctor sends himself and the other monkeys through time so they can change history in a way that 'll make monkeys the dominant creatures of the earth and humans basically nonexistant . Its up to Spike to capture these monkeys , including Spector . I know its not the deepest story , but its really amusing and fun getting to travel through time through the dinosaur age up to the future . Later on in the game I actually found it compelling . You also really grow to love Spike by the time you finish the game . I understand now , why alot of people who play the sequals wish Spike was the main character again.Gameplay elements and monkeys : Once again you catch monkeys , but its easier said than done . The first 3 levels are pretty easy , but by level 4 you will be introducesd by some of the harder and more hair pulling to catch monkeys in the game . The task of catching the monkeys is made harder by the fact that you have natural level enemies to worry about while chasing the monkeys down , like Man eating plants and annoying bees . I also have to mention that alot of monkeys are PACKING HEAT ! Laser guns , bombs , machine gun , HOLLYCOW ! Do n't get me started on the red pants monkeys later on who carry almost all these weapons as well as have extremely powerful scratch attacks that you can rarely avoid . There are different kinds of monkeys . I 'll just summarize what they do . Monkeys with light blue pants are wimpy and easy to catch . Monkeys with dark blue pants are fast little monsters and require patients to get . Yellow pants monkeys are the most common and have normal difficulty . Green pant monkeys carry missiles on their back and require stealth to get because their sensitive to movement . White pants monkeys sense you easilly and are hard to sneak up on ( understatement . Impossible unless someone says other wise ) . Black pant monkeys carry oozies/machine guns . I have to note the black pant monkeys are way harder to catch than the ones in the newer games . Then you have the abominations called red pant monkeys . Good lord do my heart stop when I have to catch one of these little bastards . Catching monkeys takes alot of patients and strategy because as you 've already guessed from my description of them , they are hard to catch . Throughout the game you are given multiple inventions from the professor that are essential to catching certain monkeys in earlier levels that could n't be caught before . Every invention is important in some shape or form and will either make a monkey easier to catch or harder , depending on the strategy used . The inventions are way better than the ones they give you in the other games . Some of the inventions in the other games are just plain useless . You also have lives in this game that you gain by collecting 100 gold arrows or a jacket . I 've had more game overs in this one then any of the other two.Levels : The levels are divided by eras ( the whole travel through time element ) . For example : Im in the dinosaur era and I play 3 levels from this era one after the other ( unlock them ) , catch the required number of monkeys , then leave , unlocking a new era with 3 more levels ( Hope that explains it good ) . Each level is unique and different which makes everything feel fresh and that much more awesome.Music : OMG ! Ape Escape has one of my favorite videogame soundtracks of all time . Not since Donkey Kong Country 2 have I entered levels just to pause and listen to the music . Ape Escape prooves music is a very important part of a videogame . The music excites you and is very enjoyable . It has the best track of the entire series and its ashame Ape Escape 2 suffers from its bland soundtrack . In Ape Escape 3 the music is reminiscent of the first one , so I think the makers learned from their mistake . My favorite tracks are Crumbling Castle , Dark Ruins , Galaxy Monkey , The Spector theme , and a few others , but the soundtrack of the whole game is just epic and fills my heart with nostalgia and joy everytime I hear one of them . It 's underrated and I wish more people knew about it.Replayabillity : Compared to the other games , Ape Escape 1 does n't have much replayabilty , unless you 're like me and love it so much you just start a new game all the time . Throughout the levels there are Spector coins you pick up . the coins are used to unlock 3 minigames in the time station . My favorite of these is galaxy monkey . The other two are meh . I really wish they had a way for you to unlock the soundtrack like the other two games . That would have been awesome.I 've gone down memory lane long enough . The sad part is I still have my old Ape Escape game , but it no longer works anymore . I 'm definately buying it off amazon . I wish instead of porting Ape Escape to the PSP , they would have ported it to the PS2 , with an soundtrack unlockable available . Given that attention is mostly put on the PS3 and other next gen consoles/games nowadays I do n't see a port happening soon ( the PS3 does n't even play older games according to some people I 've asked ) . Ape Escape is definately worth buying .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "So I 'm sure you 've played fighting games before , well forget & quot ; Mortal Kombat & quot ; , and & quot ; Tekken & quot ; because & quot ; Soul Calibur & quot ; is the new wave of fighting games . & quot ; Soul Calibur & quot ; is n't just a fighting game , it contains other great elements such as Misson battles in which you are given a mission by the game to complete .

The Nintendo 64 proved that no mateer what a CD-ROM gaming system was able to do , a cartridged based gaming system could do better . That June , the case really proved the theory with the release of Starfox 64 . The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendo 's Rumple Pak , a force-feedback device that let 's players feel each and every vibration at hand.In the game , you play Fox McCloud , a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross , a inane , mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system . There are 15 remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game , alone over twenty-five different paths you decide on your way to Andross . The graphics are so realistic and full of promise , that you see the game so vividly , you feel like you 're a part of it . In Starfox 64 , you also have the use of 3 different vehicles , depending on your course , Arwing , Landmaster Tank , or the Blue Marine sub , only used in the Aquas sea level . The game also has a fierce battle level , for up to 4 players , where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders , Peppy , Falco , and Slippy.It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game , the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox 64 . The game is exactly one of a kind in the pilot seat . While Nintendo stopped releasing the Rumble Pak with the game nearly six months later , Starfox 64 is still truly a Nintendo gamer 's paradise .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Reading magazines from 1996-1998 one thing you could n't escape was a some kind of mention of Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time . It was all over the place . Popping this in my N64 when I took it home I spent literally 2 hours just exploring Kokiri Village just cause it was so fun . But then I realized & quot ; oh yeah there 's more to this , is n't there ? & quot ; And that 's when the fun started.Graphics : Although you can probably debate this , this has one of the best graphics you 'll find on the system . Lot of areas just drop that & quot ; wow factor & quot ; , like when you first enter Zora 's Domain or the game 's many cutscenes.Sound : Although there 's no voice , except for Navi 's annoying & quot ; Hey ! & quot ; and an occasional & quot ; Hello & quot ; from her or Link 's grunts , it 's got some awesome music . One thing I love is the short ocarina songs you play , such as Song of Storms , Zelda 's Lullaby and Song of Time , plus general area music . Although the overworld music is n't like what it was on Link to the Past , it 's still great.Story : The story starts off with Link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman . Then Link is summoned to the Great Deku Tree where he fills Link in on his quest and it goes from there . Even though it can be a quite simple story , it 's just a huge epic story that kept me interested.Gameplay : The infamous Z-Targeting system that 's spawned several developers to use it in their own games . The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this . Your C-Buttons are for your weapons . B is your sword and A is your action button ( Talk , Jump , Climb , etc. ) . You 'll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour . Camera is excellent and the Z targeting helps.Even though you might be able to find this , I suggest you pick it up . Dust off your N64 and dive into what is one of the 90 's most critically acclaimed and commercial masterpieces ever .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "This brought back so many memories .

You can play single player offline or multiplayer online or with BOTS . I played offline , but I doubt that it makes much of a difference since SOF has many technical problems.This game is barely worth my time . Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 should have been beta tested , so it would not turn out this bad . This is simply of one the worst games currently out for the PS2 . It is an insult to the pc version of Soldier of Fortune . The pc version had clean graphics , fast framerate and great sound effects . The PS2 version has none of those things . My biggest gripe about this version is the very crappy frame rate , it is pathetically bad ! It has some of the worst graphics to date on the PS2 ! You 'll see this strange folding effect on the screen ; as if someone is tugging at it , because the graphics can not keep up with the action on screen.Not only does it look horrible but the choppy frame rate will also affect your game play . If someone is shooting at you from the upper level and you want to aim your cross- hairs up , it takes a couple of seconds too long and then you are either dead or the enemy gets away . The aiming controls can barely catch up to the target in time and this is very frustrating.Just imagine an internet game with tons of & quot ; LAG & quot ; , and then you 'll understand what I mean . The graphics and colors look muddy and drab ( even the SNES games look better ) . Animation is jerky and the characters look strange when they run around shooting . SOF also had clipping problems ; in some areas I spotted enemies because their arms or legs where showing through walls . Loading the game takes forever ! You can go have a cup of coffee and it will still be on the loading screen ! Then when SOF finally loads you 'll be treated to every bad thing that a PS2 game can have wrong.The one good thing about the graphics was that it was able to keep the blood and gore from the pc version- you can still blow people 's heads , arms and legs off . And I liked the fact that they included BOTS in multiplayer and you can play against them by yourself . Are the BOTS any good you ask ? Well they have a tendancy to shoot you in the back very often and they seem to have better shooting accuracy than you , but they do n't have any real strategy . They basically run and shoot a lot mindlessly . But the action is never exciting because of all the & quot ; LAG & quot ; .The frame rate is laughably bad ( like a bad joke ) . Playing Single player is even less fun and I got ticked off by one of the levels where you ride on a moving train . My character got stuck in the railing a couple of times and the enemy cpu got me with a lot of cheap shots . I found a few other places where my character got stuck to a door and the enemy came and blew me away . That 's just bad programming . If they had done a better job of beta testing SOF , this would not happen . The controlling is not bad but it needed to be more responsive ( especially when aiming ! ) The sound of effects are weak and unrealistic . The sound of gun fire from each weapon is very inaccurate and sound cheap . The Shotgun sound is too loud for its own good . Grenade explosions also sound weak as do machine gun fire . However , the music is pretty good as are the screams from enemies when you blow them away.In conclusion SOF is plagued by everything that could go wrong in a game of this type and you are better off buying something else . I feel sorry for the people that buy this game and then they ca n't get their money back . So I hope they listen to me when I say this : Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 is total junk . I suggest many other first person shooter games that are much better and enjoyable than SOF . Games like : & quot ; Timesplitters 1 and 2 & quot ; , & quot ; Medal of Honor & quot ; , & quot ; Red Faction 1 and 2 & quot ; & quot ; James Bond Nightfire & quot ; . Those games will leave Soldier of Fortune in the dust bin- where it rightfully belongs !", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Like everyone says , the first three Spyro games on the PS1 were great classics and all the others suck .
