'' . my last phone was a VGA camera and i thought by getting a phone with a 1.3 MP camera , it 'd be a noticable difference . it is n't really . however , the cameras on phones are such a relative subject since once person can think the pic looks good and others think it looks like total doodie . i would urge you to look at samples of pics this phone has taken and judge for yourself . i was n't too impressed , but that 's not why i bought the phone . the camera has a lot of neat little options ( special effects , white balance , shoot mode , night mode , self-timer , etc ) , but that 's all kinda lost when the pictures are n't that great . it should be noted that the camera on this phone and the sony ericsson S710a ( a phone very similar to the W600 ) are both 1.3MP , but the S710a has a CCD sensor , which results in better pics . the phone will also take little ( albeit grainy ) video clips . moving on ... bluetooth : does n't seem to be as easy to use as with my motorola , but i have some learning to do here . was what was cool was transferring ringtones from my friend 's SE T616 to mine via bluetooth . free ringtones for me ! i do n't have bluetooth on any of my PCs , so i can not comment on bluetooth connectivity in relation to that . i just like that the option ( bluetooth ) is there.walkman : holy crap , it 's a MP3 player on my phone ! the walkman is pretty easy to use and so is the software to transfer songs to your phone . it took me about 12 minutes to transfer 15 songs , so it 's not incredibly fast , but it 's a cool app , nonetheless . the phone can hold about 60-70 songs at 128bps ( ripping at other bitrates is possible , allowing more/less songs to be stored on the phone ) , depending on what other stuff you have on your phone ( pics , vids ) . the sound is pretty damn good . you can listen to MP3s from the speakers or via headphones . i was very impressed . the phone does NOT have a 3.5mm plug , but comes with an adapter , so all is well . i 've even plugged this phone into my car 's cassette adapter and played MP3s through the car 's stereo speakers . MP3s can also be used as ringtones . all-in-all , no complaints here ! well , except the 256MB limit.radio : nice little feature ! you HAVE to have the headset plugged in to listen to the radio , as it acts as the antenna , but while it 's plugged in , you can send the sound to come out of the speakers . radio is easy to use , channels are easy to store and radio sounds good . the radio ( as well as the MP3 player ) , will pause if you get a call and resume when you 're done . you can also use the radio and MP3 player while doing other things on the phone . headphones sound awesome.games : the phone came with six games : asphalt3D , blockbreaker , bruwnswick billiards , jewel quest , name that tune , tetris , and 3D extreme air snowboarding . all games are locked , so you can only play them for about a minute and then you are prompted to purchase them . they are $ 6- $ 8 , roughly . total rip off . thanks cingular.ringtones : again , thanks to cingular , there are only six ringtones that come with this phone , and they are pretty crappy . there are free ones all over the place , so do n't go spending your inheritance on buying them from cingular . or , do as i do and grab them off another SE phone via bluetooth . there is a little app including on the phone called musicDJ and you can actually make your own ringtones . kinda cool . i 've made a few so far and they are n't bad . well , ok , my mom said they sounded horrible , but what does she know ? syncing : this phone syncs with your contacts , tasks , notes and calendar , if you have those kinds of programs on your PC . i got my phone to sync with my outlook , which now means i 'll sell my PDA . SE 's PC suite works pretty well and transferring files is easy . however , it seems like every now and again , when i am connected via USB , it reboots my phone . do n't know what that 's about . i do n't think any harm is being done.the phone feels pretty solid in your hand , weight-wise . i 've never owned a slider/swivel phone in my life , and while it 's not the most convenient to `` flip '' open , it 's not bad . you can actually place and receive calls with the phone swivelled shut , too , which i liked.it seems like SE did n't leave anything out with this phone ( except a memory slot ) and i love it . they thought of everything on this phone : radio , little flash light , dedicated key lock button , infrared , calendar , music/video/picture DJ , stopwatch , timer , tasks , notes and the list goes on and on . the phone 's styling ( ie : orange cover ) is n't for everyone , but i love it . my phone did come with a 2nd cover , in navy blue . it 's styling and shape is great and i love the orange backlit keypad . it 's definitely a head-turner.and , above all , reception and clarity of calls is great . i 've had no complaints when i 've used the phone , the headset , the bluetooth headset and speakerphone . it 's really nice . this of course , can be dependent on your network . i live in the midwest in a fairly large area ( 260K people ) , so we have cell towers all over the place.pros : * nice size . * bluetooth , infrared and speakerphone . * radio and MP3s* clarity of calls is excellent . reception is great . * screen is nice and bright . * easy to get pics , vids , etc . on and off the phone . * phone comes with everything you need ( except car charger ) * this phone is loaded - nothing is left out ! * sony ericsson 's interface is great ; apps like the address book are loaded with room for tons of info . menus are easy to use.cons : * no memory slot . on-board memory , while not bad , is limited to 256MB . * price ( well , at full retail anyway ) . * camera is disappointing for a 1.3MP . * phone goes into standby ( screen off ) after 15 seconds . very annoying and to date , i 've found no way to change that . * games are locked for only 1 minute of play . thanks cingular ; ( not ONE free game is included . * keypad buttons are small , and close together . i have small hands , so the key size is not so bad , it 's the fact that they are right next to each other.this is a great phone . its big disappointment is the fixed 256MB memory , but for a lot of people who just want to listen to a few songs and not 500 , this phone will suit you just fine . i am hoping to keep this phone for more than six months ( which is about how often i get a new cell phone ) - it has everything i need and nothing i do n't . kudos to sony ericsson for putting out a great phone ! woo ! ; )", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The charger did come in and does charge my mp3 players like it 's supposed to .

Further , I keep my phone 's ringer on 'silent ' so coworkers do n't know when I receive a phone call . The headset simply beeps in my ear , and I click it to take the call . If I am in a meeting or the boss is talking to me , I simply let it beep in my ear 4 or 5 times until the call goes to voicemail . No one even knows I had a call coming ! If I am on the phone and someone important walks up to say something , I can easily stop responding to the person on my headset . They get the point pretty quickly , because they can hear the person I am talking to just about as clearly as I can ! Now , if you want a nice quiet conversation in a cubical , you can scoot up close to a flat object ( I use my flatscreen monitor ) and talk in a very low voice .

The two on the right , with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have . Note the obvious button showing through the plastic ( this one mutes , turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry , but it may do other things on other models ) . However , the other photos show the same headset , but without the control button -- not a different button , but nothing at all ! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150 . The other issue is color . It 's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice . From the photo , one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones , but I am not so sure .

I 've had a number of cheap or free headsets ( often even enclosed with a phone ) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound . That 's not what I want in a headset , even for $ 3 . But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill . The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets -- on both ends . It 's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset -- I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets . When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone , it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset . I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE ( 9 months later ) : I got another of these sets for a friend but , although it fit , the phone rejected it as not compatible . It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues . But that also meant that I got an extra set . About a month ago , one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard ( probably a loose contact ) . At less than $ 2 each , I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one ( and I still have two more left , having spent a total of $ 6 , including shipping ) .

I am not an audiophile , the headphones are inexpensive , and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.Here 's my report of each adapter : White adapter received from seller `` CRONUZ '' - 1 star : The cord feels flimsy . The plastic used on the cord and ends feels very rubbery . From my own experience with iPhone cases made of similar material , I suspect this cord with discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning if it does n't break before that.White adapter received from seller `` eTECH '' ( mailing label said `` iflash Inc '' ) - 1 star : The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ .

The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested . The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones . I believe I can get some use out of this one , but would n't buy another one.Black adapterreceived from seller `` Elago Design '' ( not this listing ) - 5 stars : First of all , the 5 stars is based on this being less than $ 2 . I would n't say this is the best adapter you can buy . This is however the best one I tested . The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others . The female plug has a tighter fit and no play . The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest .

I wanted an earpiece that inserted into my ear as oppose to laying on top of my ear like the old World War 2 headsets of 50 years ago . I sometimes am in noisy environments and the `` lay on the ear '' type is not designed to isolate loud distracting noises . The HS850 was difficult for me to hook over my ear and took both hands at times . Not so with the Plantronics , at least for me . It goes on my ear much easier and the earplug type earpiece shuts out more of the noisy world attempting to interrupt my communications . The earplug type earpiece also provides vastly improved volume . I had to crank up the MOT to full and still had trouble hearing it at times . Remember , I 'm not in an office cube with carpeting and noise absorbing fabric cubicle walls , but in my truck on the highway or on the plant floor . The clarity of the sound is excellent . The volume level is more than adequate for me with several levels left to crank up the volumn if I need to.The headset is bulkier than my self destructed HS850 .

At night , with my headset left on some countertop downstairs , and while I was upstairs , I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling . That 's part A .

The weird thing is that if I plug my stereo standard 3.5 headphone into that same connection ( using another 2.5 to 3.5 adapter ) I do not get audio.After many frustrating hours I came up with one workaround that works - plug an earphone into the proprietary port and check for sound , then plug another one in the 2.5 and test and then plug -slowly- the 3.5 in - this gets me audio out and then I can unplug the other two.I just returned mine and ordered another from the same vendor .

Ok , there I said it.When I saw the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset and read about it 's features I just knew it was for me . Initially it was to expensive but when I saw it on Amazon for $ 79 I figured I could n't go wrong.ROFL ! Okay , I always try and give new gadgets a fair trial before recommending it to my friends or clients or giving up on it . I have now been using the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset exclusively since December 2009.It is simply the most frustrating Bluetooth earpiece I have ever used ! After 3 weeks I turned off the voice prompts & speech recognition . It announces the CallerID for incoming calls but it 's seems to take forever to finish what it wants to say BEFORE you can answer the phone.If the earbud is n't perfectly aligned with you ear you will just tick off people if you call or answer them as they ca n't hear anything you are saying . This is especially prevalent in the car . ( 2003 Ford Expedition EB , a somewhat quite car ) It really has trouble coordinating things with the iPhone 3G . Calling out , no problem , It uses the earpiece just fine . Go to answer a call ... Not so much , it selects the iPhone and you manually have to select the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset on the iPhone menu . Okay before I get a bunch of replies , YES I DID TRY `` THIS AND THAT '' . It just did n't work properly consistent if at all on the inbound calls.Okay , with all of this , I still continued to try the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset but I have now given up on it.Perhaps I will just put it on my bookshelf and marvel at the technology that allows all this functionality in such a small form factor . I guess I 'd be more amazed if it actually worked.Pros : Comfortable and stays put on my ear.Volume level is decentGooG-411 built in and is hard coded into the speech recognitionCons : It sucks.Poor audio fidelityNot iPhone friendlyIt sucks.Battery life not to good.Really Bright blinking while on .

I do my research , ad nauseum , before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider . I 've been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730 . Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected . But like I said , I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service . Got the phones from Amazon.I , too , was taken by the looks of the RAZR , and so was my wife once she saw one . But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for ? For one , Nextel was n't making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service . ( Plus , the price for an `` upgrade phone '' for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view . Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact ! ) I got two RAZR 's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon , but your rebates with Cingular are n't worth the effort - and paid $ 99 each , best price *anywhere . * I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon 's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel . A *bunch* of money . Two words : rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone , reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well , if not better , than my i730 , which is a *great* phone , and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony , Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have . I repeat : I read some of the manual , which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book , shame on you . I was worried about the address book based on reviews , but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone , I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some . There are so many ways to configure the address book it 's silly . You can assign and create `` categories '' for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life , the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it , better than half the phones on the market today . I can say that cos I feel like I 've researched about half the phones on the market ... : ) Do this : plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night . I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone ? How clumsy are you ? I 've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it . Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot , which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times . I 'm happy with the material and it 's expected durability . Stop throwing your delicate , *expensive , * micro-electronic device around like it 's made of teflon . *Be careful . *I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it 's nature usually expensive and difficult . ( A good example is the ROKR , the so-called iTunes phone . I have an iPod , and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod , I would have bought it , but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that is n't the easiest thing to pull off well ... ) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink of an eye . It 's expensive because it 's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious . Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities , so do n't be surprised by that . Want a good camera phone for Cingular ? The Sony s710 got great reveiws ; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs . That 's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it 's not working out for me . So there 's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone . Still , I did my research so there would n't be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "DONT BUY IT .

They even give you a mirror on the back of the case ( I guess so you can see how cool you look with the headset ) . Out of the box , it 's easy to setup . Took about 1.5 hrs to charge the headset.Pros : This headset is light , small , and well designed . The ear gel is n't intrusive like the old Jabras . I would say it 's like an earphone that you would use for mp3s , except it 's made out of rubber which is good so it wo n't slip out . they give you 2 other gels if the default does n't fit . I have a small set of ears , and the default is perfect . It pairs easily with my LG PM 325 ( Sprint Phone ) . I do n't notice a difference between this and my old Logitech in terms of sound quality , meaning the quality is excellent . They heard me , I heard them , it was clear , no static . If you DO get static it 's just the downfall of BT technology ( wi-fi , walls , or microwave interference ) . It also comes with 4 different charging attachments for Motorola , Nokia , Siemens , and Sony Eriksson . You can also use the power adapter they supply which works well . I like the pen/marker sized charger you can put it in , and though I ca n't see myself using the AAA battery option to charge , it 's great to be able to charge it anywhere if need be.Cons : Well , here it is : I wish there was a wind guard . This would be a great feature to have since it 's so mobile , and would n't it be better if we could use it outdoors ? Foam is n't that expensive to add ... Secondly , there should have been noise reduction feature . Trust me , it pick up everything ; dishes in the back , people talking , stereo , blah blah . Oh well . Otherwise it 's great . . Other than that , the price is the biggest con . I got it here when J & R ; had it for $ 69 . But $ 89 ? ! Ridiculous . Even $ 70 is high for a BT headset these days . But hey , you pay for the look , feel , and fit.If you do n't care about obtrusiveness , get the Logitech Mobile Freedom . It 's cheaper .

First , recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users .

EBay may have great prices on stuff , but unless you know you 'll like something , I would n't suggest buying a BT Headset there ... way too hard to return.The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets , but it is hard to see where they scrimped . The fit and finish of the product is excellent . The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly . It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name.Using the 320 , I made several calls to automated numbers . All connected quickly , except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords . In that call , there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone . My old Cardo had the same delay , so I think this is a function of the phone.The fit of the headset is great for me . The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear , and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort .
