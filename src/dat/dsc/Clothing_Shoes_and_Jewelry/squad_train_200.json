Too beautiful to wear actually . Finally after several months passed I put it on my wrist , gave it the intial wind up to get going and took a four mile walk , gently swinging my arms as I walked . The watch second hand stopped about every fifteen minutes and I had to shake it to get it going again . Despite walking four miles it failed to wind the spring automatically and would only run for a minute or two tops before it stopped.Now I have to mail it to Invicta with a twenty five dollar check for return postage and handling plus the cost of mailing it to them ! Maybe , I just had a lemon but I urge you to wear it the day you get it to use the Amazon warranty and keep in mind that Beauty is only skin deep even if it 's stainless steel ! The one star is for being beautiful.Updated 12/07/07I mailed the watch to Invicta for repair and waited almost twelve weeks for it to be returned . After the first seven weeks I called Invicta to check on the repair status . They said it had to be mailed overseas for repairs and would take longer before it was returned to me.Yes , I now have the watch and it actually works . I purchased an auto watch winder and have left it on the autowinder since I received it . It has been running just fine and keeps accurate time.I will now wear it on my wrist and see if it holds up to daily use . The moral of the story is that while the watch is beautiful it is in reality just costume jewelery and not a serious time piece.I have increased the rating to THREE STARS but be prepared to be dissapointed if you want a serious time piece.Updated 12/21/07Well , I have worn the Invicta on my wrist daily for two weeks and it has kept very accurate time and there have been no problems . This is my conclusion . I love the appearance of the watch and the price was very affordable . I now agree with all the reviews that rave about the watch . You may be one of the lucky ones and get an Invicta that works right out of the box . I blame myself for not wearing it during the 30 day return period intially.I can now raise to rating to FOUR STARS for satisfaction and value but only if you are one of the lucky ones not to be shipped a lemon watch , even then the stellar Amazon service will exchange it during the 30 day exchange window.3/1/08 Well its back to one star for a rating . The auto=wind appears to be on the blitz . If I wear it all day it stops within an hour of taking it off my wrist , even on the automatic watch winder it will not keep running because the rotation is too gentle . What can I say , it is a beautiful watch but is really just costume jewerly . I have a seiko `` black monster '' dive watch now that is perfect in every regard.7-6-08 While the watch has been collecting dust in the draw I am still drawn to the beauty of the time peice . I now wear it again but must manually wind it up twice a day to keep it going . I am truly amazed at all the positive reviews that always start out this watch appears to be much more expensive than what I paid for it . I suspect the vast majority of those people are too embarrased to edit their glowing reviews to simply say that their watches have stopped working after a few months . These Invicta watches are all flash and no substance . Be warned , spend a few more bucks and get a Citizen or Seiko dive watch for a truly quality watch that will give years of service and uncompromized customer satisfaction . Everytime an Invicta automatic dive watch is sold an unhappy customer will be the result in a few months .

Hypoallergenic , breathable like no other band . I 'm allergic to everything , my skin is so acidic it will literally eat the chrome finish off of things . Not so with this watch , since it 's surgical stainless steel . *In 4 years , I have had to replace the battery once . Great battery life . *Attractive , gets comments . *Flashy flat glass gets attention and if you ca n't read , just tilt to angle and it works great . *Love the sparkly little crystals . *Matching brushed silver face . *Easily adjustable band . Takes a small screwdriver to pry up the clamping clasp . Easy . *Good locking safety clasp . If the catch gets loose , just give it a little pressure from pliers and it becomes tight again . *Super low profile . Sits close to your wrist which helps out on the first `` con '' Cons : *All Skagens have low-quality glass . It does chip , scratch , etc . I 'm very hard on watches so it 's definitely taken some abuse . It still looks good though -- that was the only thing that made it lose a star .

In varying degrees , all -- ALL -- had waists that were bigger than 32 .

As for the button fly -- that turned out to be the best thing . I 've found the button fly to be very comfortable , more comfortable than a zipper .

But fearing when I wash it the length might shrink too much , I ordered another pair of the stonewash in 32w x 38L -- and guess what : that longer pair had the codpiece bulge even though the shorter dark stonewash pair fit perfectly . I give up.ADDITIONAL INFO : the different colors the 501 Originals come in , are not all made from the same denim weight . If you go to Levi 's website , you can readily learn the weight of most of the colors there . Some times a light weight is a good thing for casual wear on a hot summer day .

Usually I am trying to slightly minimize the overwhelming appearance of my chest ( I wear anywhere from a 38G-44C , depending on the brassiere manufacturer ) , but this rather comfortable buttressed wonder is `` an all signs point to two Kilmanjaros '' kind of affair ! The sort of high-construct , seamed directly-over-the-nipples cups , heavy-duty , thick-banded bra that macho litterati Ernest Hemmingway and Mickey Spillane would have waxed over , and the Godfather of bras , Howard Hughes would have machinated . And while it does fit great ( though runs large ) , and makeS you feel sexy as all get out , it does NOT work with about 75 % of my wardrobe , or most modern wardrobes I would venture , as clingy knits , spandexes and thin t-shirt cottons are the order of day . The back band of the bra sticks WAY out under any rayon-thin , drapey fabric , and that 's with the correct size ; it is just a clunky kind of bra.But since Amazon sells these Bali Flower Underwire Bras so inexpensively , I decided to keep it anyway . Under thicker shirts the back band is less noticeable ( but not the upwards-pointing nipples ! ) . Hell , I might even buy another one in the suggestively named navy , `` Midnight .

It has good to combat twice , multiple airborne jumps , and EVERYTHING ! I had to replace the band once during this time ( loctite my friends , loctite ) and the battery just a few times . I am going back to Afghanistan in a few months and considered getting another Suunto , the Core , however , the reviews seemed pretty bad so I decided to get a new battery and keep the Vector . When I was stationed with the Special Forces , this watch was an issued time piece , and EVERYONE got one who was deploying to Afghanistan back then . I was n't deploying at that time , so I purchased mine since everyone else had one . The face is large ( 52mm ) and a majority of the painted numbers have rubbed off , however , the watch has never failed me . I seldom use the Compass or other functions , but when I did , they where dead on . Actually , one time flying on a mission I compared my ATLI reading with the planes instruments and it was dead on . Also , when I used the Compass for radio antenna set up , it was dead on as well . Actually , when doing land navigation testing , these watches are n't allowed because you have an advantage . In all , I have considered getting other Sports watches but this one has yet to let me down . When it does , I will stick with the Suunto Vector due to the lackluster reviews of the Suunto Core . The price has gone up since 2005 , in which I paid $ 150.00 via an eBay sale , those days are apparently long gone . I 've gone swiming , and even light diving and had no issues . The alarm works well , and the computer does all the fuzzy math so you do n't have to worry about shorter months , leap years , blah blah blah . A solid product . If you know someone who is in the military have them purchase it for you because they are cheaper on military bases.My only advice would be to get some loctite to reinforce the screws .
