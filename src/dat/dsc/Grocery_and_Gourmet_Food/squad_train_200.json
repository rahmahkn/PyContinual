Others spray alcohol-containing , leaf-wrecking oils on the leaves , leaving behind a horrible taste to me and also making the leaves oxidize rapidly , making the tea quality suck ! Numi HAD it absolutely perfect . I was ready to tell you how to get , out of their tea , the perfect GENUINE Earl Grey tea , one where the tea was n't killed by modern techniques of spraying chemicals ( essential oils are almost all alcohol , after all ; bergamot oil is almost always mixed with cheaper and easier to process citrus that grows far more places than a tiny town in Italy ) ... and now , I 'm just here to say `` move along , nothing here to see '' because in changing their fruit supplier or aging/malting process or -something- ( the tea leaves would n't likely vary so much , the brews side by side making the same color and the leaves being cut the same way and clearly the same region and process -- yes , I 'm one of THOSE tea drinkers , Steepster reviews and all ) , from the bags smelling like another brand , a rather costly one that starts with R and nearly rhymes with fishy , which has rather funky EG ( that brand sprays the leaves , which Numi proclaims my shared disdain for ) ... well , what was -- back when they had the boxes with the old man and his walking stick slumped in front of a cottage or whatnot -- the first and only EG I would drink happily , a tea I went to specific 24/7 restaurants at 2am when needing food just because I could at least count on the tea ... well , it 's a passing memory , one I have about half a dozen more memories to treasure before parting ways with Numi , probably with an email expressing sadness.I DO overall recommend their teas : The lemon myrtle chamomile , now deceptively called lemon chamomile when it 's the FLOWER not the fruit added to lovely organic chamomile , is hopefully still as wonderful , their Moroccan Mint is unsurpassed and the smoothest , sweetest mint imaginable , impossible to oversteep for that matter , able to handle a trio of steepings for that matter [ whereas Stash uses PNW mint that is medicinal , which is honestly only good to make yogurt sauce or ... medicine ! ] , and even for the ones like Golden Chai that are n't to MY liking , they 're still well made , just not a blend I care for ingredient-wise ... I simply ca n't recommend THIS Numi product anymore ( and I hope as I use the last of my others this proves the ONLY one that got `` revamped '' somehow , the `` how '' seemingly the fruit , whether they are doing it faster or using different fruit or outsourcing the bergamot processing or ... whatever they changed to make it a stinky-bagged , fruitless flavored , bitter chemical-aftertaste tea ) . I tasted the new just one night after a week of delighting in their original blend night after night , using my reliable method with precise timing and all , went away from it a full month , and in finding the last half box of the old , decided to compare them to be sure it was n't simply me being thrown off . It 's not . I do n't deem it so unworthy that it ca n't be a pleasant change for the people who benefit from our brunch outreaches geared at homeless populations , and it 'll probably be a welcome addition , but I will NOT be drinking the other 51 bags from this purchase myself , not when I have teas I genuinely love ( as I did this , which was barely drinkable with a LOT of sugar that rendered it barely-even-tea anymore -- before , it was best with a tiny bit of sugar and milk , but it was absolutely palatable with no additions ) .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "We are a Kraft dinner eating family for decades and nearly every week we cook at least 4 boxes .

I already drink iced tea a lot , so I wanted to see how I could use that to my advantage . This was actually my third pu erh tea and was the better of three . The bags were substantial and held together really well during brewing . You might have read how many folks do n't like the taste of puerh , that it tastes like dirt , well , ya , I can see that , but of the brands I 've tried this one tasted a lot less like dirt . Honestly , I do n't think pu erh tastes a whole lot more dirt like than cheap oolong . Anyway . So , for weight loss , well ... . OK , the article I read says two cups with or just after each meal and a cup of green tea between meal . I did not use this way , just ca n't fit that much in time wise what with brewing and all . I made sun tea , 32 ounces of water in a glass bottle with three pu erh bags and one green chai ( chai is my favorite tea of all time ) . When done I 'd put two packs of stevia in the raw in and I was good to go . I 'd have one cup with each meal when home . I found that as long as I was not bad about my eating this regimen would result in a tiny bit of weight loss , a few pounds , but I just could n't keep it going , eating out and stuff . If I was bad with eating then drinking this tea kept me from gaining . I can only imagine if I really followed what the article said or if I could just keep drinking it three time every day then real weight loss could happen . My current weight is quite troublesome as it is hormonal ( perimenopause ) and does n't respond to much , even exercise . To see what little I did see with this tea gives me hope . I do plan to try hitting it again and try to stick with it regularly enough to affect my weight for real . In summary , of the two pu erh teas I 've tried this one was definitely better tasting and higher quality , so if you are shopping for which brand I do recommend this brand . If you are looking for a recommendation for weight loss , then I think I can say yes , pu erh can help you lose weight , but you have to drink enough of it regularly enough and paired with green tea to get it to work . If you are looking for a healthy tea , then look no further , pu erh is higher in polyphenols than any other tea , and based on my latest cholesterol tests it really does help keep that down too .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I bought this recently , not paying attention to brand .

( you decide how much ) 1 can water chestnuts ( drained ) and diced fine up to the size of a kernel of corn.1 medium size thickly grated sweet carrot2 cups Thai sweet chili sauceThis version is sweet and mildly hot .

Do n't use tabasco or chili water unless you want a vinegar taste added.Add more or less of the vegetables you want in the `` salsa '' .Make sure that you drain your vegetables well because the sauce pulls liquid out of the vegetables . As a result the `` salsa '' is thinner and more watery after refrigeration overnight . I guess for looks you can drain the salsa of the watery sauce and add more Thai sweet chili sauce again . Use your imagination if adding new veggies and make sure that you adjust the volume of the Thai chili sauce.Mix everything in a large bowl as you add stuff and stir gently as you go.Add the magic sauce . Put anywhere from 2 cups to the whole bottle of this Thai Chili sauce , mix well , and chill overnight.Bust it out when its cold and make sure you use Tostito scoops because the sauce will pull some liquids from the veggies so the sauce will be a little thin . You need the scoop . Maybe the huge scoop Fritos will work too . You 'll be the hit of the party ... I hope ! Everyone I know who has tried the `` salsa '' has loved it . A large bowl went down very fast.This sauce is great for other dishes and I 've even poured it on my sandwich . I can see this easily being salad dressing especially with won ton chips !

I have been freaking out trying to find the original version and all I can find are bigger noodles , extra noodles and the kind with dried chicken jerky chunks and they are ALL horrible tasting and not the same as the original ! First of all , it used to have little GREEN parsley flakes to add flavor . We see them on the box . Why are they no longer in the soup ? FYI Lipton , the picture on the box should LOOK more like the product ! Are you afraid that the real soup is n't appetizing looking enough ? Well ... maybe that 's because it 's TERRIBLE and does n't look remotely like the picture anymore ! Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to be fired ... seriously . It 's bad marketing and false advertisement ! Secondly , the noodles ... The `` new '' noodles are too thick and they taste doughy and weird , they take forever to cook and once they are tender enough , they seem gross , soggy and overcooked . There are also so many noodles now , the broth tastes like water because they absorb ALL the flavor , especially the salt . Did anyone at Lipton TASTE this product before trying to force it on consumers ? Or did they think nobody would notice this cheap tasting , salty and soggy-noddle imitation that they put in the same box ? Thirdly , I have been using this for a certain chicken soup recipe for YEARS and everyone loves it . Now it comes out too salty and the noodles break apart when it stands too long . This never happened before with this product . I am fine with companies coming out with new versions of things . But why not keep the ORIGINAL version the way it was before and add new varieties ? Lots of people feed this to kids , the elderly , the sick and people with digestive issues . Changing a food product that people rely on for health reasons is a very poor idea . I do n't think Lipton thought about all their loyal customers before making this change to the product . I have stomach issues and have to watch what I eat . I am not sure if it was the nasty taste or some ingredients they changed but the `` bigger noodle '' version upsets my stomach . It never used to.I have stopped buying this brand completely now . They just have messed with the product TOO much over the years and it does n't taste like it used to . First , they took out most of the parsley and herbs to flavor it , now they KEEP changing the noodles , making soups with more , bigger and never as good as the original .

This is the original , truly . The Lee family literally invented oyster sauce . Grandpa Lee was making oyster soup and accidentally cooked it down to a thick liquid and that 's how it was invented ( its main ingredient is concentrated slow cooked oysters ) . Oyster sauce is a must-have condiment for cooking nearly every one of today 's Chinese & Cantonese food dishes ( that have sauce ) and for a good reason . It imparts a unique flavor that ca n't be imitated by any other flavoring or condiment . Not sure what they used before this was invented more than 120 years ago , but we 're sure glad they use it now.Be careful when purchasing , if you want this exact sauce . Lee Kum Kee makes at least 9 or 10 types of oyster sauce , but this is the best one they make , their `` premium '' oyster sauce . Still , I wonder why it 's so expensive , since they have the power to buy oysters relatively cheaply by the millions and have already perfected the way it 's made , getting it down to a science that for them is surely simple to do since they 've been doing it for so long . Why so expensive . I imagine they charge so much because they can , since they have such a great rep for the best flavor.They make a darn good Hoisin sauce too , plus over 200 other types of sauces.The main headquarters of Lee Kum Kee is located in Hong Kong and has production bases in Xinhui , Huangpu , Hong Kong , Malaysia , and Los Angeles . So those customers in America who do n't like to buy imports , not to worry , chances are if you buy from a store in America you 're getting the product that was made right here in California.Having said all that , it looses one star for having MSG in its ingredients . I 'm also not happy that the price is so high ( higher than other brands , no matter where you buy it ) . I always wonder , how would it taste without the MSG and caramel color . The color is naturally brown , so I do n't see why coloring is needed . And salt is already a great flavor enhancer so I wonder why add MSG . I 'm still searching for a great tasting oyster sauce with no MSG ( and not so expensive ) but have n't found one yet .

I like the Sesame ones a bit better , at least , because I like Sesame seeds.In the meantime while I try to use these up , I must say I was very excited to find a substitute that is cheaper , healthy , and crunchy - someone recommended using fresh cucumbers sliced at an angle for salsa and a number of other toppings , both salty and sweet . I 'm not that into cucumbers , but I 'm not against them either , and they do have good anti-inflammatory properties ( particularly if they are organic , or at least well-washed and at least partially peeled ) . I was amazed that it is actually really refreshing and tasty , as well as guilt-free and crunchy ! Unless you need a hot food , like you want to melt some cheese on it or something , I have found that the cucumber is far superior to this cracker in nearly every way ! Sometimes I do n't want so much water content , but I find often that is just when my body is too low on salt so adding some to what I 'm eating works fine even if it 's on a cucumber . If I still just need something dry to snack on , air-popped popcorn is a lot cheaper and easier to flavor than these crackers.They 're not terrible as a product , and I like that they 're all-natural , but I personally do n't like the taste , and thus the price is especially not worth it .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I love Haribo Gold Bears and the Rolls of the disks , but the consistency of the Haribo Gummi Pink Grapefruit is very strange .
