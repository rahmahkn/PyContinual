Who would have thought this would be a good idea ? Oh yeah , the guy behind Two and a Half Men , the show that present humor to the lowest common denominator of humanity , whoda thunk it ? This is an amazingly well thought out show in the respect of the characters , while presenting certain character archetypes , which I 'm sure will be mined for comedy gold in later seasons , we are n't left with mere empty shells of characters . Instead we actually get to love each character individually by the writers presenting the negative side to each characters oddity . Whether it be Sheldon 's staunchness in his character and inability to easily adapt to new situations to Rajesh 's inability to communicate with those of the female gender , we 're presented with characters who are extremely intelligent but also deeply flawed , creating a situation that is hard to parallel and also hard to make a strong comparison to within this genre . While granted the show does still present itself within the sitcom genre and many of it 's tropes , it manages to elevate itself above that with some intelligent writing and some brilliantly acted characters . Sadly the main female lead found in Penny is strongly lacking for me in many regards ( let 's see if they develop that later on ) she is somewhat counter balanced by minor side characters like Leslie Winkle , is this enough to alleviate the bimboness that is Penny at times , obviously not but the end of the first season does lead toward some character develop in that regard . I 'm excited that I 've finally started to watch this show because I 've long felt that with a handful of exceptions ( Modern Family , the first few seasons of Raising Hope , 30 Rock - who now that I think about it have much stronger female characters ) the sitcom genre is dying a painful death in front of our eyes .

Unfortunately I 'm at a bad point in my project . I 've already seen almost all of the shows that I 've had reason to believe are better than average shows . I 'm now left with the dregs.Now , STARGATE ATLANTIS is hardly a `` dreg '' show . I watched the first three seasons as they were coming out , until I became disenchanted with the series , in particular with the increasingly reliance on standalone episodes and on poor character development ( i.e. , lack of character development ) . I was also concerned about the show because of the elimination from the show of Paul McGillion , who played Dr. Carson Beckett , one of the more interesting characters on the show . Also , Tori Higginson , who had played head of the Atlantis Project Dr. Elizabeth Weir for three years , was planned to depart the show . Despite the addition of Jewel Staite , who I had loved on FIREFLY , I suddenly found myself uninterested in watching the show any longer.I 'm delighted to learn that not only was Season Four not a decline in the quality of STARGATE ATLANTIS , it was actually the most interesting season of the first four of the show . Part of the reason was the replacement of Tori Higginson with Amanda Tapping , who reprised her role from SG-1 of Samantha Carter , sadly available with the ending of that show . I never disliked Higginson , but I never felt that she brought much gravitas to her character ( she also bore a disconcerting similarity to an ex-girlfriend of mind , which I personally found oddly distracting ) . But the main reasons I found myself enjoying Season Four more than the previous seasons were a significant abandonment of the standalone format and the interesting inclusion of a wraith ( Todd ) as a recurring character . In fact , apart from the third episode of the season , most of the first 13 or 14 episodes of the season were tied to the main overall arc . Only in the final third of the season did a number of standalone episodes creep back into the mix . The overall result was a dramatic improvement in the quality of the show 's narrative . Christopher Heyerdahl had played a variety of wraith characters in the first two seasons of ATLANTIS . Then in Season Three came one of the best episodes in the entire series , in which Shepperd is imprisoned with a wraith ( whom the Atlanteans later name Todd ) , who to keep from starving gradually drains Shepperd of life . The two cooperate in escaping from their prison and over the course of the final two seasons Todd would provide an interesting character , often making an odd colleague in advancing causes that were in the interests of both humans and wraiths . In one alternative future , Todd and Ronon even die a heroic death together , teaming up to kill their common enemy . I 've always had a love for characters that defy surface expectations . On BUFFY I loved Angelus for being the completely evil doppelganger of the incredibly good Angel , and then later the utterly evil Spike gradually transforming ( even before he gains a soul ) an increasingly decent character . Almost always Todd 's presence in an episode means a good episode.Also in Season Four there was an increase in the quality of the special effects . I 'm not terribly conversant on CGI , but I do know that at about the same time the special effects on just about all CGI-heavy shows dramatically improved , led by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA . I 'm assuming that there may only be one CGI software package catering to customers at this level . I imagine that the small handful of F/X companies all get the latest upgrade at about the same time . In the 1990s there was a very small market for CGI and you could tell from the way that it was used on TV that it was very pricey . Because much of it was custom , there was a dramatic difference from the way that it was used on one show and on another . There are still differences . Although they are certainly using the same software programs , on STARGATE ATLANTIS the CGI shots are very clear and crisp , featuring panoramic shots fairly distance from the objects of interest . On BATTLESTAR GALACTICA you get very complex shots . In Season Four of BSG , for instance , you might get a super close up of the Galactica , with a large hunk of the fleet in the background , the whole shot not centered from an ideal observer 's point of view , but from what you would see if you were in a spaceship very close to Galactica . In ATLANTIS the visual field is uncluttered , with no cosmic dust or anything else to impair perfect clarity of picture . On BSG there are often vast clouds of cosmic dust that causes a complex diffusion of light from a nearby nebula . Both shows feature photo realistic CGI , but the uncluttered clarity of ATLANTIS shows a different set of priorities with the more complex version of BSG ( and for the record , I much prefer the CGI on BSG , which I believe represents the highest achievement so far of what can be achieved with CGI on TV ) .All in all , I really enjoyed Season Four . I am only now getting around to watching Season Five ( the DVDs come out later this month , but friends showed me some sites that stream the individual episodes ) so I do n't know how it will compare with Season Four , but I definitely prefer Season Four more than any of the first three . I now definitely regret that I stopped watching ATLANTIS . Now that I 'm watching many shows that I have little confidence in to be any good ( I just recently managed to grit my way through ANDROMEDA and fairly soon need to force myself to watch all of LEXX , concerning which I still have n't heard anything to make me at all optimistic ) , discovering how good ATLANTIS was in the season after I gave up on it has been a very pleasant surprise .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "DIalog ( writing ) setting and plot execution , acting and more make this a stand-out series .

Is it true that this season was n't as consistently strong as the stellarSeason Twoand the classicSeason Three , but there is no way that this deserves such a low rating by anyone 's standards . While the beginning was a bit of a letdown , it is still overall a strong and hilarious season.POSITIVES+ Despite what the other reviewers said , it still feels like `` The Office . '' Whatever faults the early episodes have -- and they do have faults -- are gone by the second half of the season . The second half is filled with episodes as funny and touching as anything that has come prior.+ The character arcs were handled nicely . I loved Pam/Jim , of course , and I loved the emotional roller coaster than was Michael/Jan . A lot of great stuff goes on between all the characters actually -- even Andy.+ Risks are taken a-plenty . Two main characters have left the branch . One of them has left the cast altogether , and the other has moved up to a position of power . By the end of the season , a worker will outwardly defy Michael , a cast member will go to jail , and another worker will leave the office for good.+ This collection also comes with a script ( `` Dinner Party '' ) , which was a wonderful surprise . I 'm a screen writer , so checking out this script was an essential and revealing look into the mechanics of the show.NEGATIVES- The first few episodes feel quite off , and I think these are probably the main reasons people rate the season low . Both Michael and Dwight act even more outrageously than usual in this episode , and the plotline with Dwight and Angela 's cat was really pushing the limits of believability . Also , the first four episodes were hour long ones , so the dynamic of the show -- short , punchy episodes -- felt a bit off for a while.- The comedy seemed more slapstick than before , what with the car going into the lake , the mushroom incident , and the Meredith being hit by a car thing.- I 'm as big a Pam/Jim fan as there is . They are the couple I am very much rooting for ; but I felt that Karen was sort of tossed aside without enough plot focusing around it . It made Jim , as a character , seem sort of cold . I loved their interaction when they finally crossed paths , but it did seem a bit too little , too late.BEST OF THE BEST1 . The Deposition : Michael 's best `` that 's what she said '' jokes yet , along with some really heartbreaking stuff2 . Goodbye , Toby : `` The Office '' has never been able to match Season Two 's `` Casino Night '' when it comes to season finales , but this comes close.3 . Branch Wars : Jim gets sucked into Michael and Dwight 's antics , which leads to an awkward moment with an ex.4 . Dinner Party : Michael 's home life explodes5 . Did I Stutter ? : Ironically enough , I came to respect Michael as a boss in this episode.OVERALLGood season . Not the best of the series by any means , but still a very entertaining comedy .

Such is the case with BIONIC WOMAN.This remake of the hit 70s show that starred Lindsey Wagner ( that was a spin off of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN ) updates the original , keeping only what 's necessary . Jamie Sommers is young , in love and pregnant . After breaking the news to her boyfriend Will ( Chris Bowers ) , the pair are broadsided on the way home.Damaged to the extent that she might die , Jamie is saved by Will as his true occupation is revealed . The man she thought was a simply college professor actually is a brilliant surgeon who works for a secret government agency . And rather than lose Jamie , Will takes her to their facility and enhances her.While her legs , one arm , one ear and one eye were completely obliterated , this facility replaces them with bionic parts , mechanical computerized parts as well as nano technology that boost her healing . Horrified at first , Jamie begins to accept the new her . When Will is killed by the last candidate for bionics , Sarah Corvus ( Katee Sackhoff ) , Jamie joins the agency that rebuilt her.That 's the simple set up for the series . Super strength , eyesight , hearing and more . Working for a government agency . And with a revenge motive strong enough to fill any number of stories . But the series does n't stop there . As well as her new found life , Jamie has a kid sister to raise . Troublesome and a handful , the teen was dropped at her doorstep by her father and was the reason Jamie stayed where she is . A combination of love and loss revolve between the two.The series takes a natural progression , from Jamie being talked into her new career path to how she deals with Sarah . The series shows her progression , her training and her learning to deal with her abilities . But what makes this series work best is that it 's not a straight out remake . Instead , it takes those bones from the original and makes the story it 's own.Michelle Ryan stars as Jamie and does a fantastic job , showing a young woman who takes what life throws at her and survives . Miguel Ferrer does his smarmy best as the cold hearted bureaucrat who 's in charge . Sackhoff is equally casts as the killer who wants to change but has technology that was n't perfected within her.Cost of living what it is , there is no way Jamie can have been made for a mere $ 6 million . Times have changed and so has this show . But that 's a good thing . While the original seems silly to look back on now , science fiction fans can find much to enjoy in this one .

While I had a long-standing desire to read the book , I had n't heard of the concordant documentary and was anxious to see it when I did hear about it.Before I go on , let me regale you with the latest shill 's message to me regarding this film : `` It is your assertions of racism , etc . that are anti-intellectual . I could , in fact argue that YOUR discussion of `` Black names '' reflects a rather insidious degree of bigotry . In addition , your criticisms of the quality of the data are amazingly uninformed. '' WOW . Sell a lot of books this way , do you ? By insulting an honest reviewer , then demanding back-up evidence ? This is a REVIEW , not a doctoral thesis . The idiots who made this film have the burden - not I . Mine is onerous enough writing to audiences filled with readers like YOU . And the filmmakers are the ones who raise the whole issue of `` black '' names , not I . And that is what you can expect from a film like this.The film is a huge let-down ; it certainly steered me away from the desire to read the book . I 've come to the conclusion that the appellation `` rogue economist '' ( as Levitt calls himself ) is a big red flag with Sarah Palin 's silhouette on it.Full of somewhat interesting but ultimately useless and mildly offensive trivia , the documentary 's biggest mystery is why several directors were hired to film the various segments . Some of the segments are downright insulting to the intelligence.In a word , stupid . Or , in another word , Wallywood . So here are the basic parts of this broken machine : REALTORS ROBBING CLIENTS : Levitt and Dubner yammer about the way realtors rip off their clients in the good old American home-selling scheme . While I found it informative , it could have been done more briefly and a lot more deeply.CHILDREN 'S NAMES : This is about whether a child 's name will affect that child 's success later in life . It seems Levitt 's whole point is to show how certain names could lead white girls to a stripper 's life . I found this segment racist , aside from being offensive and frankly stupid.We all know the black community prefers specific names , and the documentary explains the well known phenomenon of black people getting the shaft when it comes to jobs . I doubt that is only because of the names the black community chooses but this film insists it is . In any case , I do not need statistics to explain that to me : I am half black.However , Levitt ( the apparent heavy-lifter in all the fact-finding ) tells us more : did you know that among rich white folk , the most popular names for girls used to be Jessica , Lauren , Ashley , Sarah and Emily ? Among `` the Wal~Mart crowd '' ( their term , not mine ) , the most popular names were Ashley ( `` Trashley '' ) , Jessica , Amanda , Samantha and Brittney.I was having a hard time understanding how the white strippers relate to the problems of the black community and vice-versa , but there you are . Apparently , these two stalwart researchers also claim that the name Tyrone `` is a black name . '' I have news for you : it is not a `` black '' name . The only thing in the world that is `` black '' in this context is the skin of some people . And that 's not `` black '' , it 's `` brown '' .Gee , I guess pointing that out makes me the racist here.SUMO MATCHES ARE FIXED : Next we have a segment about Sumo wrestling corruption in Japan . Plus the exciting topic about Japanese police and their general incompetence . It 's really a segment about religious corruption because Sumo is a sort of extension under the Shinto religion . This was a good segment , but a totally confusing mish-mash if you are not already familiar with Japanese culture - which this documentary assumes you are.ROE V. WADE DROPPED OUR CRIME RATES : These dummies claim Roe v. Wade and the whole abortion issue might just be the answer to lower crime rates . How 's that ? - you may well ask . Levitt did a study of the evil Romanian dictator Ceaucescu and his draconian you-have-to-have-a-baby-NOW laws from circa 1989 . Levitt found that about 20 years later , Romanian crime had skyrocketed . Coincidence ? Based on this interestingly weak observation , Levitt decided to study U.S. crime rates dating 20 years after the Roe v. Wade decision . He claims he found crime had plummeted . Levitt asserts 50 % of that total drop was thanks to Roe v. Wade and all the criminals-to-be that were never born . Allow me to explain why this is bad statistical use : Levitt freely asserts 50 % of the drop in crime to be thanks to Roe v. Wade . He presents no evidence that he delved into ALL the necessary statistics to make that assertion.What is freely asserted is freely negated - any critics of my review familiar with THAT ? If anyone expects me to quote statistical analysis here for the purpose of refuting these clowns , well , I do n't have to do so . The burden is Levitt 's . And he fails.BRIBE THE KIDS TO GET GOOD GRADES : For me this was the most stupid segment : an experiment in Chicago to bribe 9th graders to get good grades . The authors of the experiment believed bribes can and should be used to get these kids to do their schoolwork . As opposed to getting out on the street , joining a gang and possibly making several thousands of dollars a day doing whatever it is the gangs do.This type of film pains me . It is the usual pseudo-intellectualism camouflaged as something I can only label as 'significant trivia ' , and it has more to do with arrogant researchers who are full of themselves than it has to do with facts . Naturally , it deeply moves pseudo-intellectuals . This film tries to be light-hearted and humorous , but it falls flat.These `` experts '' are offensive idiots : they manage to insult the poor of all colors ( is that funny ? ) , the black community ( oh , that MUST be funny ) , struggling parents ( definitely not funny and most unwise ) AND kids in dire need ( just plain horrible and psycho ) . We can safely add that the authors/film narrators in some odd way have made pro-abortion people feel weird also.Imagine how they have offended cinema and the art of documentation.This certainly put me off reading the authors ' book . Since I have a little bird who tells me things , I have had it brought to my attention that Levitt and Dubner `` read reviews '' . Well , gentlemen , I hope you learned something from my review . The public has a right to know all balanced criticisms . Apparently , some strange enemy has read my review already anyway.Please know : my review is a great deal more fair than the documentary .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I heard a whole lot of comparisons between this film andThe Cabin In The Woodsbefore I decided to give this one a try . And why not ? The latter film is probably one of my top three favorite `` horror '' films of all time , and definitely the smartest nod to the genre I 've ever witnessed , regardless of how funny or scary you think it is . This film , written long before CABIN IN THE WOODS , tries to approach that same level of wit and insight into the genre , but the problem is that the script is just too shoddy to pull it off.The film follows two gentlemen in a cabin in the woods ( natch ) . One of them -- a young husband and father-to-be named Michael -- has come to visit Chris -- his old , estranged , meth-smoking friend -- in an attempt to finally wean him off of the drug . Michael takes an old-school approach to rehab , handcuffing his friend to a pipe and letting him sweat it out , and as the two bicker ( with fairly repetitive and awkwardly curse-laden dialogue ) and relive old times , strange pictures , films , books , and recordings begin popping up around the cabin . Where are these things coming from ? What do they mean ? Will Chris -- the healthiest-looking meth-addict you 've ever seen ( check out those biceps ! ) -- be able to kick his habit ? Will Michael allow his own pride to blind himself to the fact that something seriously creepy-deepy is going on ? The idea behind the film is great . I give it five stars . I do n't even fault the film for its low-budget execution , which is pretty solid , all things considered . The film is a mediation on the art of story-telling , especially with regards to horror films , and its constant nods to various horror tropes -- aliens , strange disappearances , Native American burial grounds , ghosts , creepy religious types , foreign scientists -- is cute enough , but none of it is particularly compelling . Even when something pretty creepy does happen -- a mysterious person stares at our leads through the window or a recording of them appears unannounced -- one or both of the characters inexplicably does n't care , which effectively neuters the response of the audience . If viewers are supposed to be yanked to the edges of their seats , so should our characters , and what they mainly do is just argue about drugs , friendship , and life.Not until the last twenty minutes of the film do things begin to gain some kind of steam , but it 's an old fashioned case of too-little-too-late . By then , the bizarre occurrences of the film have become very obvious ( i.e . heavy-handed ) symbols . This is further hammered home by Michael 's insistence on referring to every set of photos , every scratchy record , every cave painting as a `` story . '' This kind of overdone symbolism is especially weird considering the film 's general insistence on remaining aloof from the typical spoon-feeding you get from most scary films . Smart viewers will get what 's going on , but there 's bound to be a sizable chunk of the audience who will finish the movie and wonder , `` What was that last shot about ? '' In case you missed Michael pounding it into the dialogue : it 's about something , somewhere that wants a story.The trippiness of the overall story just does n't hold enough water to compel the plot , is the problem . And in a movie that is all about the things that make a story worthwhile and that even cause stories to exist to begin with , it 's a shame that the producers focused so much on creating a powerful ending without thinking about what it takes to have an equally powerful beginning and middle . As a result , you have a movie that 's too smart for its britches , that seems to have been made backwards , with its strongest and greatest ideas placed at the end . But like a powerful anchor attached to sewing thread , this film 's ending is stuck to an hour of quiet nonaction that is not particularly creepy , interesting , or even all that sensible ( did I mention that our film 's meth-head looks like he could be a lightweight boxing champion ? ) , and so the density of the finale makes the preceding hour of movie seem even fluffier and more pointless than it already is , rendering the entire experience kind of a rip-off .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I am on ep 9 , and the good hero 's are still going strong and some good characters are ..leaving , but being replaced with more great characters and twist .

Not in any part . The acting , the direction , the scenery , the set design , the script , the music , the ending -- it all worked together , all paid off.This starts off slowly , gently . But from the first images of children playing a game in the yard fronting a large , mansion-style orphanage -- the shadows , the direction , the way the action of an innocent game is set up -- perfectly sets the tone of the film . It 's nostalgic , but it 's also slightly creepy . It foreshadows a lot . Pay attention.Zoom years later . One of those children who 'd been playing in the yard , the girl Laura , is now grown with a son . We find out the main characters -- mother Laura , father , son Simon -- have purchased the former orphanage and plan to set up a residence to care for special needs children . Simon , himself , is a special needs child : He has HIV.Soon , the game of `` invisible friends '' takes on an ominous reality . And every scene builds tension , builds , builds , until we really are at the edge of our seat as this mother is thrown into the greatest nightmare of parents.The film then asks the question -- of the lead and of the viewer -- how far will a mother , this mother , go to find her missing son ? While the conclusion felt inevitable and was pretty obvious quite early on ( the clues are all there , and the script does not cheat ) , it 's the HOW of getting to it that makes this all work . Almost all is fairly foreshadowed , but the small actions and words that lead us along to those conclusions can be easily missed if we focus on something that seems more emotional.I can not describe how beautiful the finale -- the climactic moment -- is . Tragedy , sorrow , redemption and beauty all coalesce . It is a miraculous cooperation of acting/direction/storytelling/setting/lighting and music that brings us to this moment of bittersweet magic.The denouement is lovely , too , leaving us with a feeling of what we lose as human beings , mortal beings , and what we can gain if there is more than mere matter.Tragedy redeemed -- that 's what I thought as I went to bed after seeing this.Yes , this is a ghost story that disturbs mightily , and the scares are surely present , but it is not a gore-show . It is a more human and artistic ghost story , and is in fact MORE than a ghost story . It 's a story of family and friendship , and of a mother who will not give up , because the deepest love outlives the grave , even defeats the grave.You really need to see this film . Magnificent .

The series is BONES and there is no better way to watch this than on DVD . Why ? Because once you get into the series you 'll want to continue on rather than wait for the next episode.Just released is BONES SEASON THREE : TOTALLY DECOMPOSED EDITION . How can it be that this show has been on that long already ? For those unfamiliar with the show its time to catch up.Based on the real life of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs , the story revolves around Dr. Temperance Brennan ( Emily Deschanel ) , a forensic specialist who works at the Jeffersonian in Washington , D.C . When the FBI comes calling for assistance in the form of Agent Seeley Booth ( David Boreanaz ) , Temperance takes to field work like a pro with an intense interest in each case presented.Along with Temperance , known as Bones to Booth , are a team of equally dedicated professionals at the Institute . Among them are Angela ( Michaela Conlin ) who specializes in facial and body reconstruction via sketches and computer software , Dr. Jack Hodgins ( TJ Thynes ) who specializes in organic materials and Dr. Zack Addy ( Eric Milligan ) who knows more about bones than , well , Bones . Each member of the team adds to a complete whole not only in their expertise but in their character functions as well.For the first two seasons we were allowed to explore the world of the `` squints '' , Booth 's nickname for the intelligent research team at the Institute . But as the show continued , we watched as Booth came to appreciate each individual in their own way . We also watched the sexual tension between Booth and Bones grow in the most subtle of ways as they worked case after case together.There you have it , the main crux of the series . But it 's more than that . It involves cases being solved using clues found only by this team of forensic anthropologists . Each week they discover clues no mere mortal would find with the naked eye . And each week Booth and Bones have the chance to put the guilty behind bars . At the same time we get to watch the interplay between the characters as well.What you have here is a combination of age old detective show combined with the technological side shown in the various CSI series . But rather than focus mainly on the science of evidence we get that as well as interaction between characters in more familiar TV territory . Romance and buddy systems are seen in each episode as opposed to straight police work.This brings us to season three . This time around we begin with Bones acting unlike herself . Could it be because Booth sent her father to prison at the end of last season ? Could it be the attraction between Bones and Booth became too much ? Or could it be because Zack had decided to take a leave and head out to work in Iraq ? Just as the stories offer clues to the murders , the series offers clues and at times answers to these questions.As the season starts we find Hodgins and Angela still very much in love , still planning on marrying and still searching for the man who was a one night stand Angela married in a drunken stupor . This was an arc left open from season two that finds an answer this year.Zack returns from Iraq a bit different . Fortunately for fans of the series ( and Zack ) he shows up in the first episode , just in time to save the day and help find the criminal.Bones and Booth start off not nearly as close as before . Whichever of the reasons discussed that seem to have had an effect on Bones is clearly visible from the first minutes of episode one . And as the pair start to work things out , they begin therapy to help with their work.The first show offers a new challenge for viewers and the team as they encounter a secret cannibalistic society that has left their calling card . While the Gormogon killer may not be a familiar name to most , it will be by the end of this season . Not only are the guilty not found by shows end but they continue to show up during the season.A more in depth view of Bones sex life is offered as well ( no , not seen ) as we begin to meet the men she dates . This seems to upset Booth who does his best to hide it . The affection between these two characters may be more blatant than Scully and Mulder of X FILES but it is still held in check for the present.Humor , mystery , relationships and friendship are all regular topics in each episode of the series . And Season Three brings forth more of the human characteristics of each member of the forensic family found here . It is these human qualities and interaction between characters that makes this show the success that it is . While Bones comes off as cold and out of touch with the world around her , Seely comes off as having lived more than his years would seem . Put these two together and you come up with one of the most successful teams since Nick and Nora Charles.Extended episodes , alternate episodes and more make this box set worth adding to your collection . And if you do n't have them already , buy the first two as well.This is a fresh series with great acting that makes the entire production believable . And that is what makes for good TV . And good TV now means good DVDs . Take a 3 day weekend or the holidays to get acquainted with the Bones family . It 's a great mystery filled time for all .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "The series came and I had a marathon Saturday watching , great stuff .

So , all of her more real life magic and charm was expected for her breakout series , `` The Mindy Project '' ( which came about from `` Untitled Mindy Kaling Project '' , meaning this show really does n't even have a real name , to it ) .And while Mindy 's chick-flick charm , mixed in with small flashes of intelligence or competence does work here , she simply is n't enough to hold an entire show . While her best friend and Office co-star , BJ Novak is also working on this show with her , and she has some backup in the form of NBC buddy cameos , like Seth Meyers and Ed Helms , the fact of the matter is , none of the rest of the show is good : Her believability as a doctor ( unless you were to get racist and assume it 's because she 's Indian ) , her insufferable and BORING supporting cast , and her premise of being an adorkable girl starring in her own self-imposed `` life as a romantic comedy . `` The show is supposed to be a companion show to `` New Girl , '' but at least 'New Girl ' has it 's niche : It 's a girly comedy with enough manpower and masculinity in the form of her support cast roommates that it balances itself out for all audiences between 16 and 30 . However , `` The Mindy Project '' does n't have any of this , and it 's only real audience seems to be girls ditzy enough to be into Kate Hudson movies , like Mindy Kaling/her character , herself . There is no real audience appeal , because not all women in their late 20's/early 30 's are like Mindy , and honestly , there 's no real reason for men to watch , at all . The show is n't funny enough to break any demographic barriers , either . It 's mostly not funny , at all . Add in NO likable or interesting support characters , and a boring career premise with Mindy as a 'stupid , yet smart ' doctor , and it 's just overall lame . Even at it 's BEST , it 's a mediocre comedy.Mindy Kaling herself has the energy , charm , and pep to at least hold the show on her shoulders for maybe a full season , if that long , but none of the other elements of the show are really worth it .

There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who are n't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV , not a single one , that my wife and I do n't flock to week to week , other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception . As the 3rd season played out , we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season , all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger . A serial rapist . A murder on campus . All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then , when the show started back up , all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes . The following episodes were , for lack of better words , UNEVENTFUL . All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending . What did they do ? What happened ? Did the writers lose interest ? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes ? This is what I think . Personally , I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them . So , they in turn , gave up on the CW.All speculation aside , VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season . The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact , but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it 's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts . The ratings that they 're suffering are n't because of quality of show , but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies ... like the big boys do ... cause we 're watching ... and unfortunately , we 're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Had heard great things about this series and sampled 5 shows last night .

So do n't watch this expecting laughs like I did , and maybe you wo n't be disappointed . It is extremely depressing , and if I had watched this while depressed , this movie would have made it much worse.And , by the way , to the reviewer who said not to leave negative feedback because the movie does n't live up to expectations , I say this : It is described as a COMEDY . Not dark humor . Not black comedy . Not even `` intelligent humor '' as another reviewer said . If I had known this movie was going to be so dark and depressing , with ONLY a laugh or two , I would n't have been expecting one of Robin Williams ' comedies . I 'm fully aware of his amazing ability to do comedy as well as drama , but I do n't like to see a `` comedy '' movie about suicide , accidental or otherwise .

I finally watched my very first episode of `` Dexter '' last weekend , and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days . This is an amazing show about Dexter ( Michael C. Hall ) , a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer . However , Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to : He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished . The first season of `` Dexter '' revolves around another serial killer that 's been terrorizing the state of Florida . The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes , cutting them up into pieces , and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places . Dexter works with members of the police department , including his adopted sister , Deb ( Jennifer Carter ) , to find the killer . However , Dexter ca n't help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer 's meticulous technique . He soon begins communicating with the killer , who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful , repressed memories from Dexter 's past.I became hooked on this show very quickly . Hall is amazing as Dexter , who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history . The supporting cast is excellent , especially Carter , Erik King as Sergeant Doakes ( the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing ) , and James Remar , who portrays Dexter 's father in flashbacks . I 'm not particularly fond of Rita 's character ( portrayed by Julie Benz ) . She 's incredibly wishy-washy , but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality . I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation , intriguing as it was , could have been a bit less obvious . ( I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away , so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant . ) Overall , though , `` Dexter '' is a very unique and compelling show .
