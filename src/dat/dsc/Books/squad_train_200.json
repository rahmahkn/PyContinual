The available historical information is limited , usually coming from surviving writings of monks , although some information can be found in Danish sagas and such . The author has filled in the gaps with historical fiction based on known battles , births and deaths of kings and other leaders , and known details of society during that period . The action is carried forward by the fictional character Uhtred . The series started with his support of Alfred the Great , who has now died and been followed in succession by his son , Edward . This novel extends into the beginning of the 10th century.The novel departs somewhat into various side issues involving Uhtred , who seems to survive in various battles and other actions ( including a confrontation with a supposed seeress who could tell fortunes ) . There are various confrontations with the Catholic church ( Uhtred is a pagan who believes in Norse gods ) . The status of women during that time period seems to be accurate - they married young and often died young . The lifespan of men was also much shorter than now . Uhtred describes himself as an old man of 45 in the shield wall during a battle.The Danes will obviously outlast Uhtred . Battles between Saxons and Danes continued into the 11th century before the Danish power was broken in both Ireland ( by Brian ) and in England . The Saxons and Danes would eventually battle each other into exhaustion , and the Normans would move in and take over ( the Normans being descended from Vikings who settled in Normandy ) .Depiction of Saxon life in England seems to be accurate . White slavery flourished in England and the rest of Europe , and white slaves were a major commodity in trade . That would continue for several more centuries .

So why the 4 stars ? First let me tell you why I would have given it 5 stars : I love the dramatic events of history that have changed the course of humans and the plague certainly is one . You only need to visit the affected areas in Europe to realize the historical impact of this event . Mr. Kelly seems to have done extensive research ( even though I am no historian ) . He documents his accounting through writings from various sources closely connected to the event , sources who often did n't live to see a brighter day . Yet these very personal accounts of the plague are the strength of this book . We really can feel the impact of this horrendous event on the individuals whose accounts he discovered in his research . And perhaps more interestingly , we see how the rich and powerful ( and holy ) tried to escape almost certain death.Another reason I would have given this book 5 stars is the author 's research on the origins of this plague and its differentstrains ; I kept a map of Asia/Europe beside me while reading so as to trace the beginnings and follow its destructive path . He answers many questions about how it took hold and was so successful in its biological mission to kill and the various ways scientists , philosophers , teachers , and ordinary people tried to understand and deal with this crisis . ( This often made me think about diseases killing us today for which we have no answers for cures . ) A third reason I would have given this book 5 stars is its pure & # 34 ; fright & # 34 ; factor . This event must have been one of the most horrifying ever experienced by man ; parents watched as their children died one after the other , or worse , they fled to avoid catching the disease , leaving their children to suffer an excruciating death all alone . The details can be gruesomely overwhelming yet fascinating at the same time.So why 4 and not 5 stars ? It 's pretty much the same story from place to place , whether in Venice , Florence , Avignon , Paris or London- people died in the same patterns and numbers . In fact , I 'm half way through the book and may not finish because it 's the same thing again and again . True , there are interesting stories tied to specific people , like the Pope in Avignon , that are injected here and there , but basically , once the plague got going , it killed in the same way over and over again.So who should read this book ? Anyone who loves history , particularly of Europe , and is familiar with the places so dramatically affected by the plague . Anyone who likes to contemplate how something we can not see can wreak havoc on the human population ( still true today ) and anyone who loves a gruesome , gory TRUE story .

The only reason I was able to finish it was the fact that I had 12 total hours on a plane going to and from Europe.So the first 100 or so pages were spent , amazingly enough , describing Adriana & Colton 's meeting after 16 years of his absence . No action , just flowery , excessive , repetetive dialouge . 100 pages of tiny print . Let that sink in for a moment.When finally we got out of that hallway , I felt like I had acomplished some amazing task . I was hoping that NOW maybe the book would go somewhere ? Nope ! And it never really did ! First there was really no romance between our characters ... Even though the book summary promised that Colton would be our `` reluctant suitor '' he certainly was n't ! He began lusting over Adriana from the very first day , when he intruded in her bath and stands there staring at her for a good 10 minutes , then makes crude remarks to her when she wants him to leave . Oh , how romantic . Then we are reminded every other sentence of the fact that this happened , and just in case we forget , that Colton wants her hot bod.It was ridiculous how Adriana was so affected by Colton 's refusal to enter into a marraige contract with her when she was 6 . S I X. then about 50 or so pages are taken up with her lamenting and chiding Colton over his actions ... like her heart was broken.There was nothing likable really about either of our main characters . they were uninteresting to the extreme . Beauty was basically the only thing mentioned to redeem them ... I 'm sorry , but taking care of orphans and being a war hero are such cliched devices ... They get married about halfway into the book . From then on , we really dont ' see much of them . There , the story begins to drunkenly focus on some of our 'secondary ' characters , both unlikeable . Roger is so unrealistic , and it seems that his character actually changed since the begining of the book . Hmmm , as I recall , the very first sentence was of Adriana running playfully away from him and laughing , when later she claims she could never stand him ! and him being scared to enter due to the memory of Colton 's father ( who lived there ) even though later we learn it was he who murdered him in that house ! The whole plot device of the actress Pandora , Colton 's 5 second marriage to her , and the baby that she claimed was his but somehow miraculously was later proved to not be his , but a relative totally detracted from everything.Some ridiculous scenes I can remember from this book are : after Adriana is pretty much naked and was just almost-raped by Roger , Colton is left alone with her after he saves her , ogles her , and can only think of his lust for her . Wow.When Colton is shot and brought into a room , the butler Hodges starts talking to Adriana trying to make her feel better or something . It was a ridiculously long speech .

Steve is on trial for murder ( he is accused of being a lookout during a robbery resulting in the death of the store owner ) , therefore the screenplay unfolds as an intense courtroom drama , where majority of the witnesses are criminals who were at some point cut a deal to testify against Steve and Steve 's alleged partner and killer - James King.Second , the story raises a multitude of questions about guilt , peer pressure , racial stereotyping , and flaws of court system . How can you possibly trust the testimonies of criminals , who do so only to reduce their sentences ? Is Steve guilty or he just happened to be in a wrong place at a wrong time ? If he is innocent , how can a Harlem black boy possibly distance himself from criminals ( who he is only acquainted with ) in the eyes of the jury ? If he is guilty , is his screenplay a way for him to convince himself of his innocence ? If he was in a fact a lookout , does it make him a murderer ? And does it even matter if he is guilty or innocent if in the eyes of people around him he is a MONSTER regardless of the outcome of the trial ?

I read it because my young teenaged daughter wants to read it , and I always try to know what she is reading . I also had been told how awesome the story was by adults in my life . Please keep in mind , that this is how I feel about the book and I am in no way trying to say that no one should read it ( everyone should read what they want and then make up their own mind ) or that if you loved it , as an attack on you.First I will say why I gave the book a generous two stars:1 . The pace was good and did n't drag-that helped me get to the end a lot faster.2 . I loved it when Augustus ' parents would n't let them watch a movie in his basement.Now for why I was so disappointed:1 . The characters ' development was non-existent . I never connected with Hazel nor Augustus . The fact that they had cancer was almost an after thought ; and the struggle , arc and growth that you would expect from a plot with two teenage cancer patients was just not there . I also feel like we were never even given a chance to get to know their families either . The supporting characters were more like stage props than the SUPPORT that a supporting character provides a story.2 . I figured out the dramatic/ & # 34 ; traumatic & # 34 ; twist of the story half way through . Not only did I figure it out , but when the scene happened , I found it to be very ANTI-climatic.3 . Language ... I am adult and when I read an adult book , I am totally prepared for language . This is advertised as a teen/young adult book and let me remind you that one reason I read it was to see if it was appropriate for my daughter to read . I do n't necessarily mind when a book meant for teens has one or two little profanities , especially if it is in the correct context of the situation the character may be facing ; but the language in this book is ridiculous . There is no good reason for the majority of the cussing other than to have teenagers cussing . Ironically , the one instance that I DID NOT have a problem with is when Augustus drops an f-bomb . It fit the scene and what his character was experiencing in that moment . Now , I am in no way saying that it is RIDDLED with profanity , because it is n't . I just did n't see the reason for the cussing that IS there . To me , it had no purpose.4 . The pain did n't seem real . Cancer , and especially cancer in children is a horrific thing to contemplate . I never felt their pain , their fear of dying , there anxiety . That the fact that either one of them could die soon was the reason for their utterly fast and all engrossing relationship was not communicated well . The cancer was made to be more of an annoyance and the parents of the children with cancer especially so . I HATED how Hazel and Augustus treated their parents ' concern for their wellbeing and how their parents were written to be these blubbering , annoying individuals with no depth . I was especially disappointed in the idea of & # 34 ; cancer perks & # 34 ; . Even if that is true , the fact that Augustus at one points acts like he thinks it is ridiculous in one part of the book , only to manipulate people with it later in order to get what he wants ( like champagne on a plane ) really got under my skin.So , there it is . I am sure that most people wont like my review because they love a book that I do n't , but that 's ok . I do n't expect everyone to love the books that I do and that 's just fine .

Same as people who do n't believe in God without physical proof , then they say God could n't exist without such proof . '' `` Unfortunately for morons like audiophile , they think science always means something they can directly touch or see ( as if that would always even be proof in itself ) . '' `` It 's actually funny that we made a troll go away so fast . a testament to our skills . D. Keene and wanners defeat the troll . yeah ! `` According to those who attacked me in the comments section of my own review , I am a troll . They make incorrect assumptions about my character and view of science , then conclude that I can be dismissed on the basis of their own inventions.Ultimately , I found the behaviour of the commenters to be quite revealing , and supportive of my claim that this philosophy is complete bunk . Advocates of this book seemed to cling to their dogma with an almost psychotic fervor , reacting aggressively against any presentation of doubt , as if questioning the premise they hold dear would somehow cause their belief system to crumble . It is a weak philosophy that can not tolerate scrutiny . And this is a very weak philosophy.Do n't waste your time or money on this book.Here is my original review : I was excited to read this book because of my strong belief that alternative treatments such as proper diet , sufficient exercise and emotional well-being are critical to good physical health . I 'm a vegetarian , I have a supportive social network , and I believe that it 's important to walk in a natural environment every day . I am in the choir , and even I got tired of the whining . Further , I read a lot of made-up stuff about psychosomatic illness that seemed to be just plain hokum in the 150 or so pages I choked down in combination with how the author feels that everybody in `` the medical community '' is out to get him for his `` revolutionary ideas . `` About the fifth or sixth time the author said something like : 'I know that `` the medical community '' is going to jump all over me for saying this , but ... ' and then say something completely banal like people in pain are in emotional pain , too , I had enough . Sarno 's assertion that physiological problems can be influenced by emotional issues is not a breakthrough . Caroline Myss ' 1996 `` Anatomy of the Spirit '' explores fully what Sarno only swirls around , toilet-water-like , but never manages to actually say.Perhaps Sarno is a great guy and has really helped people feel better , but that does n't mean he can write worth a whit . A well-written non-fiction book states clearly what it plans to say , the points it will address , and then elaborates these in detail in its later chapters . This author starts out by describing his trials and tribulations in getting `` the medical community '' to accept his trivial and throwaway epiphanies , and the book never really seems to go beyond that.This is a book for people who want to have a big jeer at `` the medical community '' that has failed them ( hey , it happens ) , or people who enjoy believing in conspiracy theories so that they can sit alone in their apartments watching TV without feeling bad about it .

One not-so-unique position that comes out immediately is that Mormon fundamentalists consistently misunderstand the complaint against their practice , and this book seems to dive right into that misconception . The misconception is that the non-polygamous public are concerned about pre-marital sex , and thus the Dargers waste a lot of time elaborating that they were all virgins going into this , that day the three of them got married . It 's as if the rest of us can all relax , since they were virgins.When I read books about polygamy , I look for what usually gets no attention at all . What about the young boys who grow up in such families ? There are n't women for all of the men to practice polygamy , and therefore , inevitably , large numbers of young men drop from these groups at a rate proportionate to the number of women being taken into polyguamous relationships . Just look what happened to Valerie . She married a man more than twice her age , who already had four wives , and the abuse they all suffered because of this man was subhuman , as she describes it . But where are all the excess men going who ca n't , because of sheer number , practice this life they 've been raised to believe is so important that they call it the `` Principle ? `` I attended a book-signing with the Dargers and I asked them about the problem of excess males who have no one to marry , but are all obligated to follow the commandment to do so ? My question was quickly shuffled aside , unanswered . I 'm getting used to that . At some point , polygamists are not going to be able to shuffle away the questions that incriminate their religiously-based polygamy . They can hardly speak for these men who leave at a very young age . They are in no position to say that any of them leave simply because they chose not to be polygamists . These young men leave for a variety of reasons , one being that all of the girls their age are getting taken as polygamous wives to men sometimes many times older than they.I also think the Dargers owe the rest of the world an explanation about tolerance . They wish for it , but would a black person of African descent be eligible for their Mormon fundamentalist Melchizedek Priesthood ? This requires a yes-or-no answer . The LDS Church changed their view on this matter in 1978 . Have the Dargers and the priesthood authorities with whom they affiliate followed the lead of the LDS Church . I know the answer , but I 'm not going to speak for them . But if they are clinging to pre-1978 Mormon policy with regard to black men of african descent , it 's a little hypocritical for them to be begging for tolerance . They need to be very specific about this answer.Brooke Adams was there and she answered that in her experience , most FLDS men do not end up going into polygamy . Well , should n't that go without saying ? It would be physically impossible for that to happen . Brooke was only explaining what we should obviously expect in a society where population ratios ensure that less than half of the men are able to practice `` The Most Holy Principle . '' I felt like they were trying to give the impression that most men `` do n't wish '' to stick around , but that 's just a sneaky assumption they use to avoid to problem . In polygamous communities , men leave by the scores , while women are held for life . There 's nothing equal about that , and the Dargers are contributing to the problem . Brian David Mitchell has showed what can happen in that situation . Unable to practice polygamy in a Mormon fundamentalist group , he kidnapped a teenager for himself.The Dargers are very nice people indeed , and I hate having to ask probing questions like this , but since they 've chosen to take a public role in describing their practice , they should also give equal time and honesty to the consequences of polygamous society , even if everyone is over age 18 before they marry.Yes , there are problems in monogamous society too , but monogamy does n't set itself up for failure this way . Polygamy fosters a sort of elitism among the men who have enough prestige to acquire many women .

But then , anyone who writes a review here has disqualified themselves already . Others , I guess , get some kind of vicarious thrill out of reading of their exploits which consist mostly of bar hopping , listening to music , chasing girls , and ripping people off . I have no problem with that , it 's a valid diversion . If they just got on with the drinking and screwing I would be fine with it . it 's just that the flowery prose on how everything they `` dig '' is so over the top wonderful , rings pretty hollow when you look at it.There is a lot of Cervantes in this tale . The true reality around them must be elevated , at all times , to impossible levels of wonder . I mean for God sake ... Look at the authors description of Hollywood ... or for that matter of Bakersfield ! Dean as an anti-hero is particularly boring . After the first chapter , you can predict what he will do all the rest of the way . Blah , blah , blah ...

Since I did n't have the `` Vietnam experience '' I can only review the book based on the story itself , so forgive me if my rating does not include it 's relevance to the Vietnam era .The beginning of the book was pretty good , despite some inconsistencies , and as I approached the middle of the book I planned to give it 3 stars . This first half of the book takes place in space , as our main character goes though boot camp , graduates , and goes on his first mission to fight the enemy aliens . Most of this is pretty good story-telling , though as a hard science fiction fan I was disturbed by a few `` common sense science '' issues:1 . The space army is made up of the `` best and brightest '' of earth ( everyone with a masters or doctorate in the sciences is automatically drafted ) . They go through rigorous training but we do n't see much in the way of military tactics being taught . That 's because once in actual combat they are given a post-hypnotic command that turns them into unthinking killing machines ( author 's description ) . Why do we draft the brightest minds of all humanity if all we 're going to do is say some magic words and turn them into mindless murdering zombies ? 2 . Boot camp is on a frigid , absolute-zero world , but our soldiers cope with that by using high-tech suits with insulation so perfect they need a heat exchanger to keep from dying of heat stroke . The environment is so dangerous that half the recruits will die during basic training , mostly from accidents where the hot heat-exchanger fins touch frozen helium and cause an explosion . Like me , you may wonder why none of these `` best and brightest '' people ever thought about using the perfect insulator material of the suit as a protective cage around the hot fins , or to use it on their boot soles to keep them from sliding on frozen lakes of helium that evaporates as soon as their foot touches it . Or why not leave a small area of the suit with a less-than-perfect insulator so you do n't need an air conditioner at all , or why not.. ( the list goes on ) .3 . Once we have a battle , the alien base is captured , and we have lots of other-worldly gadgets to play with , you might expect the `` best and brightest '' solders would be put to work trying to make sense of this new technology . This could be an interesting part of the story , but no , instead we bring in a never-before-mentioned team of `` scientists '' and the soldiers go back to the ship . I do n't expect much from the scientists , considering they can only be the `` second brightest '' people from earth ? The story really gets bad once our heroes make it back to earth , where , with relativity effects , about 30 years have passed since they left . This new earth is full of impossible economic and social situations , such as:1 . Unemployment is over 60 % , yet menial jobs pay so much money that a person can afford to live on a fraction of the actual wages . ( I say `` menial '' because it only takes a day to train a new person to take over your job and you split the salary with them , keeping half for doing nothing ) .2 . The United Nations controls all the jobs , and doles them out to only the poorest citizens . Yet with such absurdly high pay scales it is never explained how a previously-poor person keeps his job for very long , because after a year or two the person must be reasonably wealthy , and thus lose their job to a poorer person.3 . With the economy so bad and jobs in such high demand , you might think those controlling the jobs would be subject to bribery , but we 're told they are `` 100 % incorruptible '' . On the other hand , all you have to do is contact your local black-market job dealer at the corner bar and you can get a second-hand ( or third-hand ) job in no time , where you work someone else 's job for 1/2 , 1/4 or even 1/8 of the salary , which is enough to live on , so much so that you can afford to pay the black-market job dealer a portion of your 1/8 wages.4 . Crime is so bad that every non-criminal citizen must hire a personal bodyguard so they can survive the elevator ride to and from their apartment . Wait - I thought the UN controlled all jobs , so where do personal body guards come from ? And how does the 60 % of the population living on government subsidies pay for their bodyguards ? Is body-guard pay included in your government check ? 5 . Because the entire planet is in a constant state of starvation , criminals about to be sent to jail are shanghaied by farming communes for use as slave labor , but the commune keeps the criminal 's government food ration book and uses it to supplement their food supply . Really ? The government ca n't track the criminal fugitives by their ration books ? 6 . The farm communes are constantly being attacked by roving gangs of starving people , who steal the farm 's food and then `` escape into the forests '' . Forests ? Huh ? In an over-populated world where food is scarce we still have un-farmed forests for the hoodlums to hide in ? Why do n't they just cut down the trees and start their own farm ? At this point I was still reading , ( as I re-read this review I wonder why ) but when I came across this next gem I had to end the torture - The biggest fear of earth is that the alien war will end and wreck the economy . What ? The economy is not wrecked now ? And how could keeping the best brains of humanity on earth instead of killing them off on a distant planet wreck the economy ? How could using all our high-tech gadgets to improve living conditions at home be worse than sending our technology into space never to be seen again ? And how could keeping the GDP of a planet circulating though the economy cause economic turmoil ? This world created by the authors is so unbelievable that I simply could not continue reading the book . I am not such a critical reader that I ca n't overlook a few inconsistencies here and there , especially when they are minor distractions and not critical to the plot .

In addition to the 918 pages in a rather small typeface , every scene , conversation , subplot , and theme is written by Stephenson to the point of absurd information overload . And that 's the point , turning this into a manifesto of tech-obsessed sarcasm and paranoia , with prose that is ponderous but surprisingly fun to read . Nerdy language is used to great descriptive effect , especially in the way Stephenson describes settings and character developments & # 8211 ; one example among many being `` his net worth is a negative number that can only be expressed using scientific notation . '' Stephenson 's writing takes on the characteristics of the scatter-brained deep thoughts of his various math-nerd characters , and this makes for a bodaciously braindraining read.The narrative goes off on bizarre multi-page tangents like a mathematical theorem about when a character 's bike chain will fall off , or a specific mechanical treatise on another character 's method of eating Cap'n Crunch . You 'll often wonder where Stephenson 's going with this longwindedness and why you 're struggling through so many hundreds of pages of woolgathering , but with patience you 'll find that the prose and style of this novel add immeasurably to an astonishingly intricate and ambitious plotline . With this story , Stephenson has blown the roof off of cyberpunk and modern speculative fiction , seamlessly linking the ultramodern with the past into an incontrovertible whole.Most notably , Stephenson has defined retro-cyberpunk here , as he reconstructs nerdy codebreakers and analog cryptanalysts from WW2 into the original hackers and the geniuses behind the earliest digital computers . The war is transformed into a paranoid web of codes and spying that underlie the everyday horrors of slaughter and destruction , and Stephenson uses this device to analyze the true inhuman futility of war and its effects across generations . Meanwhile , his intricate conspiracy extends from the war to the present realm of super high-tech , with modern hacking and programming descending from the cryptanalysis of the war . After nearly a thousand pages the disparate storylines come together into a profound and wide-ranging conclusion about the human condition , while Stephenson has also ably explored the relationships between people , economics , history , and technology .

He explains in an afterword why he thought that this choice was the right one , why to do otherwise would be to shirk the true implications of his story -- and he shows some humility and sympathy for the people who actually experienced this terrible day . But it would take a writer more brilliant than Lamb ( at least as he performs in this novel ) to do true justice to that real experience . I found his use of this event , with its shock value , more prurient than illuminating . I know this was n't his intention , but his use of Columbine seemed manipulative and exploitative to me .

One day a few years later he gets a call from the New England Patriots in the middle of a season . They need an experienced long snapper for their upcoming playoff run , and offer Kinchen a tryout . Brian , looking to his faith for guidance , eventually gets the job and lives the dream at age 38 of getting a second chance at football and playing in the Super Bowl.For those who do not know , a long snapper is a football specialist who hikes the ball during punts and field goal attempts during games . It is a skill not many possess , and is much more difficult than it sounds . During critical moments , the entire game literally is in the hands of the long snapper . One poor snap at the wrong time in a game and the ball can go sailing past the punter or holder , leading to a deciding score by the other team . As the Super Bowl approaches , Kinchen develops a bad case of the `` yips , '' so familiar to many golfers who suddenly develop problems sinking the shortest of putts . It is a mental block , and Brian tries everything to recover his lost form , eventually trusting in his faith in God and the power of prayer.The Long Snapper is readable enough , and you genuinely want things to work out for Kinchen . He sends fun and inspirational videos back home to his students during the football season , and he describes in detail an often forgotten and yet critical position in the game of football . The story suffers , however , from long passages where Kinchen `` testifies , '' professing his faith in God .

I 've reviewed every novel in the series so far , and all of those reviews have been extremely positive , so by now it 's probably no secret that I 'm a huge fan of these books and their author . That being said , Stormed Fortress is an outstanding novel even by the incredibly high standards of this series.The conflict between the half-brothers Lysaer and Arithon continues unabated . The fortress mentioned in the book 's title is Alestron , home of the s'Brydion family which has played such a large and complex role in the conflict between Lysaer , the false avatar of the Light , and Arithon , the Master of Shadow . Lysaer leads the forces of his Alliance of Light to the s'Brydions ' doorstep , and through no fault of his own Arithon is drawn there too , which sets up the confrontation between the two half-brothers that 's been brewing throughout this arc.Plot threads that were introduced four books ago at the start of the Alliance of Light arc come to fruition in Stormed Fortress . All the setup that took place in the earlier books pays off here , from Arithon 's involuntary doppelganger Fionn Areth to Lysaer 's complex and fascinating henchman Sulfin Evend . The Koriathain continue to plot , with Arithon 's love interest Elaira caught in the middle , and the Fellowship of Seven balances its long-term duties and goals with the immediate danger posed to the key players in this story.As you 'd expect from the title , a siege plays an important part in the plot of Stormed Fortress . And as people who are familiar with Janny Wurts would probably expect , the author describes this siege in a way that 's second to none . Just like the previous book in the series contained a description of a necromantic ritual that simply blew every other instance of necromancy in fantasy out of the water in terms of depth and attention to detail , what we get in Stormed Fortress is almost the platonic ideal of the description of a siege . The tension is practically unbearable , not in the least because the author manages to maintain it for hundreds of pages and describes it from various points of view , from the common soldier on up : '' Let us do what we can for your people . '' Hard-set , dedicated to practical mercy , Talvish shouldered his captaincy . He was no sorcerer , no musician , no blood-born seer stung by the vista of far-sighted consequence . He accepted that he had naught else to give but the conviction of human resolve.The amazing thing about this series is that it 's incredibly complex , but in a completely different way than you 'd expect based on its size . Writing even a basic summary of the state of affairs at the end of this eighth novel would take up several pages . Janny Wurts achieves this level of complexity with a relatively small cast of characters , as opposed to series like Steven Erikson 's MALAZAN BOOK OF THE FALLEN , which features huge numbers of characters and races . With Janny Wurts , the complexity lies instead in the web of motivations that drives each of her characters , both as individuals and as part of whatever group or faction they belong to . Before I started reading this series , I was told that `` it does n't sprawl , it deepens '' -- and now , after having read everything but the newest novel Initiate 's Trial , I understand completely what was meant by this : the story that 's being told here is essentially the same as the one we started out with at the beginning of The Curse of the Mistwraith , but throughout the series the author continues to reveal additional layers , reposition the markers , and explore the characters ' relationships and Athera 's deepest mysteries in ever-increasing depth . It 's no wonder that this is one of those series people end up reading and re-reading over and over.I 'm starting to get to the point where I will buy extra copies of The Curse of the Mistwraith , the first book in the WARS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW , to hand out to fantasy fans who have n't discovered the series yet . It 's simply incomprehensible to me that more people are n't reading these books . The entire series is back in print in the U.S. , and the latest book in the series , Initiate 's Trial , is coming out today , so if you are looking for an intellectually challenging but incredibly rewarding fantasy series to read , this is a great time to get started .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Like a lot of people , I originally read this novel in high school .

Perhaps it 's because they were so upset about the long wait . Or maybe it 's due to the fact that the series ' most popular characters , Tyrion , Dany , and Jon Snow , are all MIA . There 's also the problem that Martin takes up a few unclear plot threads that , by the novel 's end , lead seemingly nowhere . These are legitimate gripes , but it 's important to evaluate the book as it is and not as it should have been . Here you should find that A Feast of Crows , though uneven at times , is just as addictive as its predecessors.I will admit this book is more subdued than its predecessors , and it lacks the major plot events as well , but nonetheless it is a remarkable read . The novel is almost worth reading for Cersei 's parts alone . She is the novel 's major character , and her schemes driven by her intense paranoia are lots of fun to watch unfold . We get a deeper look into the characters of Jaime and Brienne , who both get to set out on adventures that , if anything , help paint a picture of the landscape left behind by the war of the five kings . Samwell remains one of the few untarnished `` good '' characters , and this novel shows the beginnings of major things to come his way . Arya and Sansa both play minor roles . While I enjoyed Sansa 's parts because we get to see behind the scenes of some of Littlefinger 's scheming , Arya 's part was not done quite so well . It 's unclear where Martin is taking her character by the end . Three of the Greyjoys also have character perspectives , and they 're a little more interesting than I thought they would be . Mostly I liked the kingsmoot . The Dornish as well played a small part , mostly from behind the eyes of Arianne Martell , but these are the least interesting parts of the novel and Martin could have done without them.What makes these books so great is the human factor . These novels are about human failures and the frailty of human success . Many of the characters have some major flaw , defect , pain , or weakness . Brienne is a woman with the build and looks of a man . Tyrion is a dwarf . Bran is a cripple . Jaime is a warrior without his sword hand . Sam is fat . Prince Doran has terrible gout . These are men and women who are unable to mask their vulnerabilities , but must work that much harder to make up for them in the novel 's cruel world . Pain comes much more often than not . Almost all of the characters are strongly driven to achieve some goal , which makes it that much more disappointing when they come upon a powerful force working against them . The end goal of this series is that somebody will be crowned king/queen of the Seven Kingdoms , and maybe more . Only one person ( or two ) can achieve this goal , which means that most of the characters in the series are doomed to failure , and that 's just a part of human life . We will fall in love with characters and root for them , but only one can win , and it ca n't always be the one you 're rooting for.While there is certainly a little unevenness in A Feast for Crow 's story , Martin 's accomplishment in this series is astounding . He has done the incredible feat of juggling a massive assortment of complex characters and intertwining them in a fantastic story . Part of my own feelings of disappointment lie in the fact that the book had to end . There 's also the fact that I really wanted to know where Tyrion ran off to , and I want to see Daenerys continue to kick butt , and I 'm very curious to see how Jon Snow handles his new Lord Commander position . At least book five is already out . My main concern is that by the time Martin finally releases book six I will have forgotten so much I 'll need to keep turning to the map and the character list every five sentences .

After becoming a renowned writer both nationally and internationally , he went into exile , settling in France in 1987 . & quot ; Soul Mountain & quot ; was first published 3 years later in Taiwan.The leading character in this autobiographical novel is a writer who is considered persona non grata by the government . After being wrongly diagnosed with lung cancer , he sets out on a spiritual journey through China in the hope of finding his true self . These themes reflect the author 's own experiences . He was also wrongly diagnosed with lung cancer and left Beijing for political reasons to travel overseas . The name of the novel comes from the destination of a person the protagonist meets on a train . After this meeting , he is also filled with an urge to visit Soul Mountain , but does n't know how to get there . Instead he goes to a giant panda reserve deep in the mountains , visits tribal villages , and stops at an ancient city to muse on the great poets of the past . He also visits his childhood home on the Yangtze River only to find that it has been completely modernized.The message of the book seems to be finding contentment in our lives . The narrator encounters people satisfied with what they are , such as a ranger living peacefully in a remote area without any concern for money or prestige . He also meets a traveling monk who used to be a doctor before , and asks him why he became a monk.One of the tricks Gao uses is the ambiguous use of personal pronouns . He meets 'her ' during his odyssey , and enriches the narrative by telling her numerous stories , but who she is remains unclear . Because the narrator is on a spiritual journey as much as a physical one , we are left unsure as to whether he finally reaches Soul Mountain.Using the journey as a metaphor for life , this novel tries to explore many of the issues that face us in life . For some , this will fill a spiritual vacuum and seem very profound , but for others - especially cynics like me - this will seem as profound as a 528-page fortune cookie .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Spoiler ALERT : This book was ok until i got about 58 % of the way and the author kills Chase ! he was the one i loved and i was so upset and annoyed that i can not read the rest ... .do n't get this book nothing good about it ... read thoughtless and effortless or crash and clash and of course a beautiful disaster ... ..", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "Fia and Annie are sisters .

In the many references to political events I noticed some errors and imprecisions . Of course , one can argue about the selection of the many hundreds of persons described by the author , who have made geat cultural , artistic or scientific contributions . As a Dutchman , I regret that Dutch leading artists , philosophers and scientist did n't get their due share of attention . Barzun 's chapters on the sciences are not quite on the same level as those on the arts , and especially literature . But in such an ambitious and , on the whole , succesfull master piece , all these objections only concern points of detail . The author justifies his sometimes arbitrary selection of the persons he describes with the argument that new developments rarely are the work of a single person . Mostly , new ideas are already in the air . There are always different contrasting and conflicting ideas at work . One of the major advantages of Barzun 's magnum opus is that the author has a sharp eye for the fact that no epoch is characterized by a single idea . For instance , Barzun makes the reader conscious of the fact that there is more to Victorian morality than a narrow-minded , repressed attitude towards sexuality ; that puritanism was not solely characterized by fanaticism and bigotry ; that Rousseau 's ideas were less absurd and one-sided than most people believe and that Nietzsche ment almost the opposite of what the larger public thinks he ment.Barzun starts his work around 1500 , the time of Renaissance and Reformation , two currents of ideas he rightly considers as representing a new starting point for western culture . He frequently reports events which you hardly will find at any other place . For instance the political activities of de Beaumarchais , author of The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro , who in 1776 as a secret agents helped to finance the American revolt against the English . A very positive thing is that Barzun regularly gives advise about accessible books in which questions treated by him are exposed at greater length . The drawback is , of course , that reading all these books would represent almost a life time of reading ! An other objection against the book could be that little notice is given to economical factors . Phenomena like the labour movement , colonialism and decolonialism could have been treated at greater length . And when Barzun critically notices that all these modern household appliances do not always make life more easy , but often tend to complicate it , het omits a reference to the important social phenomenon of the virtual disappearance of the domestic . But in defense of the author , I have to point out that for economic and social history there exist other books . Barzun 's speciality is the history of ideas . In this he excells . He considers literature to be our most important source for studying the ideas that dominate a certain epoch.Quite controversial , of course , is Barzuns opinion , which he expresses in the title of his work , that Western Civilization has now entered a period of decadence . Barzun sees a number of manifestations of this decadence : - the dominant exagerated relativism , which prevent people of distinguishing works of real merit from garbage ; this results in artists and thinkers not being stimulated any more to great exertions in order to produce works of quality ; ( This is a tendency also criticized by the French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut in his book La d & eacute ; faite de la pens & egrave ; e ) - the prevalent moral laxity , which leads to the decay of education and the increase of criminality ; - the persistent denial of the necessity of self control and a sense of responsibility , which increasingly erodes the moral foudations of our society ; - the by now almost unbridgeable chasm between an avant-garde art , that in some respects has derailed , and the larger public ; - the co-existence of a technical elite , who excells in a one-sided , very specialized expertise about small areas of knowledge , with a semi-literate mass , which does not have any respect for anything pertaining to higher culture ; - the increasing fragmentation of society . Under the pretext of national identity , auto-determination and subculture even larger groups of people are turning their backs to the rest of society . With the decay of Christianity a whole set of values and norms shared by the entire society has disappeared.Barzun recognizes that techne ( science and technology ) is florishing more than ever before , but in his view that does not compensate for the prevailing decadence in other , more important areas of culture . Barzun recognizes that decadence is not an abnormal phenomenon in an overly mature civilization . He situates the beginning of this decadence not in the years after 1960 , nor even in those after 1920 , but already in the period around 1890 . When the author claims that in the past decades this decadence has reached a terminal stage , he is to somber , I think . Or anyhow , I hope . He does not exclude the posibility that on the ruins of western society , as we know it from the past 500 years , a new civilization will arise in due time.Those who think that current society with its lazy we are the world ethos of cheap progressivism , unbounded relativism , indifferent tolerance and uncommited humanitarianism represents the akme of moral perfection , will be well advised to take notion of the signs of desintegration and decadence which Barzun brings to our attention.To conclude , I can heartily advise reading this book to anyone who has the time and the stamina to read a fascinating , but demanding book of 800 pages . You do n't have to agree on every point with the author to recognize the value of this book . Having formulated quite a few minor objections , I have to say that in view of the merits of this book , I would consider it a sign of Dutch stingyness to withhold Barzun even one of the five stars .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "i was to young to know any of this at the time .

But the movie version -- including outdated ideas , sensational assertions and gross misunderstandings -- is what this is . After reading this book -- which , fortunately , I did n't pay full price for -- I am happy to see from the reviews posted here that others have spotted its many flaws.Quite a few people who come to this book WITHOUT much background in medieval history or medicine find it fascinating , and feel they have learned a lot about history from it -- though admittedly it 's also rambling , repetitious , VERY poorly edited and sometimes difficult to keep track of . ( I 'll second all those criticisms but wo n't address them here . ) On the other hand , people who actually KNOW something about biology , anthropology , genetics , epidemiology , demographics or material culture will be brought up short by Cantor 's sloppy thinking and downright inexcusable ignorance.One reviewer comments , `` Cantor 's research for this tome must have been incredibly extensive , since he provides excruciating details for every topic ... '' But in fact , it 's those very fascinating details that are often wrong . Just about any time I found myself saying `` Wow , I never knew THAT , '' it turned out later that Cantor was wrong . For instance , he clearly did n't even bother to verify his facts on the old `` Ring Around the Rosy '' legend -- check it out on the Urban Legends Reference Pages ; the song seems to hve come into existence in the 1880s.As for demographics , he confuses the statistics on life expectancy badly , saying that a modern actuary would have given the 15-year-old Princess Joan `` just about ten years to live '' , based on an *average* life expectancy of 25 . This is highly misleading , because the highest death rates were among children under 5 -- if you made it to age 20 ( only about two-thirds of the children born actually did ) , you could expect to live at least into your 50s , even under the appalling sanitary conditions of the time . And Joan was a princess . relatively well cared for and well nourished , and might have lived even longer . King Edward I lived to be 68 ; Eleanor of Aquitaine ( 1122-1204 ) lived to be 82.He also asserts that men might be on their third or fourth marriage by age 45 , ignoring the fact that women of that age might almost equally well be on their third or fourth husband . The tendency for women to die in childbirth is nearly balanced by men 's tendency to die in wars , brawls , or hunting accidents.His carelessness about material culture is at least as great . He perpetuates the myth of the Great Unwashed by asserting that people did n't `` bathe '' -- they may well not have immersed themselves completely in water , but at least the upper and middle classes washed their bodies regularly ( a sponge bath and a good rinse ) , changed their underwear frequently , and swept their floors daily . He regularly gets clothes wrong : women did not wear `` corsets '' in the 1300s , and also a velvet altar frontal is not a `` vestment , '' nor would it be used ON the altar . ( Vestments are clothing , cloths ON the altar are always linen . ) The real problem , though , is that Cantor apparently has n't figured out how to write competently for a lay audience . He seems to think the public only wants the `` movie version '' of history . I 've read several of his other books , and his textbooks -- where he 's not trying to be breezy or topical , or to air his sometimes crochety opinions of modern life -- are fine . His _Medieval Lives_ , on the other hand , is terrible : it 's at least as sloppy and filled with errors as this is . The worst parts are where he 's trying to be funny.I read William Manchester 's _A World Lit Only by Fire_ perhaps seven or eight years ago , when I knew less than I do now , and found I think nine errors of fact in its first dozen pages . And I do n't have a PhD , just a good liberal arts college degree . In a morbid way , it 's amusing to hear THAT book praised as better than this one .

The positive one portrays John , Robert and Ted Kennedy as liberal `` saints '' committed to a progressive revolution in America . The negative one shows the Kennedys to be rapacious libertines who throw off all social conventions in their personal and political lives . Leamer 's book transcends these over-simplistic views and covers the lives of patriarch Joseph P Kennedy and his four sons , bringing out the complexity of this unique group of people.Those who hold a negative view of the Kennedys will find much material to confirm their beliefs . In truth , Joe Kennedy seems to be a man with almost no redeeming virtues , a virulent anti-Semite and pro-Nazi , greedy and miserly , manipulative man . The second generation of Kennedys learned not to ask where the family 's money came from . Yet Joe Kennedy went on to implement needed reforms in the Security and Exchange commission to which he was appointed , supported the progressive FDR and became the most powerful Catholic in the US.Similarly , JFK went on to be an incredibly reckless philanderer who possibly compromised the very security of the US with liasons with women involved with organized crime and possibly even East German intelligence , but at the same time , he inspired young people to volunteer for the Peace Corps and set American on course to landing on the Moon . RFK goes to work for family friend Senator Joe McCarthy and works with the Mafia in order to destablize Castro 's regime in Cuba , but then also works vigorously against the same Mafia and institutionalized racial discrimination ( and somehow escapes the taint of his association with McCarthy ) .Leamer show that JFK and RFK were definitely not `` soft liberals '' . JFK was the best friend the `` military-industrial complex '' ever had , pouring unprecedented amounts of money into defense and space projects . They supported a very tough anti-Communist policy in Cuba and Vietnam which almost led to nuclear war and did lead to the quagmire in Southeast Asia . One important point about the book is that Leamer does not demonize various `` bad guys '' from the positive Kennedy Myth , such as General Curtis Lemay and other military men from the Cuban Missile Crisis , FBI Director J Edgar Hoover who was friendly for many years with Joe Kennedy and showed great forebearance with the many indiscretions of his sons and had good reason to be concerned with JFK 's behavior and finally Lyndon Johnson who loyally served the Kennedy Administration and yet was treated with contempt by RFK and many of JFK 's advisors ( although not by JFK himself ) .Finally , the author has come to the same conclusion that other investigators have arrived at regarding JFK 's assassination , namely , that it is very likely that the assassin , Lee Harvey Oswald was motivated , either with or without the knowledge of agents of Fidel Castro , to kill Kennedy in revenge for the Kennedys ' attempt to kill him.It is not easy to cover the lives of five different men in a singel book , and much had to be left out , but as an introduction to this remarkable tribe of American aristocracy , this book is indispensable .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "This book was chosen to be read by my book club and I dragged my feet until the last minute because I thought that I 'd be bored with the subject .

Too infrequently do Americans even breach the subject of political philosophy with any depth , primarily thanks to our general tendency for pragmatism ( if we are being positive ) and superficiality ( in a more negative sense ) . Stossel 's light-hearted text does not aim to be a treatise on Libertarian thought but does function - in a wholly American style - to broach the subject of this political philosophy through concrete examples in his exodus from `` social liberalism '' ( which is often just called liberalism today ) to classical liberalism , that of the Libertarian.Stossel begins with his common , gut-level misperceptions of what the direction and aim of consumer reporting is . Though a series of stories , he came to realize that much of the sensationalizing which the media was doing ( and the people were consuming ) was nothing more than fear-mongering which actually diverted a great deal of attention from more important matters . In addition , this fear-mongering takes on a character of duplicity by both excoriating large entities ( business and government ) while calling for the same entities to take action ( particularly government ) . From a series of such realizations , he came to realize that much common sense is found in the political philosophy of Libertarianism , in its dual pillars of laissez-faire capitalism and individual liberty . He proceeds in a non-comprehensive way to show that such freedom has been beneficial , particularly in the elimination of material poverty.Peppered with other light considerations of the meaning of liberty , Stossel 's book serves as an excellent , albeit very , very light , introduction into Libertarian thought for American readers .

My , my , what a jealous temper tantrum , just because she did such a nice job with it.IMHO Bikram was hypocritical because HIS teacher , by the last name of Ghosh , had actually done the work of putting this series together , and it was customized to Bikram 's physical problems that he was trying to recover from . Bikram did n't start teaching this series until the year after his teacher 's death , so of course he did n't have to pay his own teacher any royalties .

The old Armande certainly has more insight , daring and power than she does . Also , Vianne claims no kinship with the gypsies , which bothers me because she 's been in their boots exactly and now looks quite 'bourgeoise ' and established.And on the other , the 'Bad Guy ' , if you will , is a priest , 'the Black Man ' , the embodiment of everything she and her mother feared , as women , as witches . That could have been quite a revolutionary and daring lead - if Joanne Harris had taken it . But the scary boogeyman is quite defanged ; he monologues in every other chapter , describing 'Vianne Rocher ' with positive superlatives ( he is n't supposed to do that you know , he 's supposed to see reality through his own prism , and therefore use derogatory words where someone else would use praise ; same subject , different viewpoints ) , he 's stuck up and deeply steeped in hubris ... but honestly not very scary . Also he has a Secret - but who cares ? Ok , he will speak in the pulpit against the vice of gluttony - that does not pack a punch , and furthermore he stops as soon as he 's feeling ridiculous . Then again , what did Vianne expect ? If you settle in a small French village , you WILL get curious stares , not open arms , and sometimes downright hostility , especially as a foreign unconventional unmarried mother ! And I 'm not even going to mention Corsica ! Of course you will get the bigots , the people who never traveled to the next county , the judgmental appraisals , the wafer-narrow-mindedness ! That happened to my family and we 're French ! The story develops slowly as there are not strong pushes toward climaxes and anti-climaxes , everything turns out well , even when Vianne tells Jos & eacute ; phine to confront her violent , drunk , abusive husband . Who of course does n't manage to hurt her anymore ( hum , so much for wishful writing - he could have beaten her to a pulp , but of course he does n't and considerately leaves town ) .Joanne Harris delights in the description of ptisseries , forgetting maybe that most of them are regional - but good for them if she can make them all . The whole country is rightfully proud of its culinary tradition - I doubt anyone , even a priest would condemn chocolate delicacies , especially in 1995 . It is important to remember France is Catholic , not Protestant , and as such has always partaken in things that horrified our soberer neighbors - all that gilding , all those jewels in church , all our baroque and gothic splendors , food as gourmet art - oh no , the Catholic church renounced nothing ! About the movie ; it is tighter than the book , I love all the actors , but it is watered down even more by making the Mayor the antagonist , not the priest . By that point it loses all 'oomph ' , although setting the movie in the 50s does help with the general atmosphere of rigidity , and adds something to the transgression of consorting with gypsies . Johnny Depp can only be Juliette Binoche 's love interest , not a secondary character 's like Jos & eacute ; phine , so it 's cute and quaint and completely devoid of backbone .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "... a bit slowly for my hunger of this story xDIt 's amazing how you end up rooting for all the characters ( some more than others , obviously ) Are n't all perspective right no matter how opposed they may stand ?", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "I saw the book listed on Oprah 's list while searching for something my wife might like .

I ordered it anyway ( the audio version , we both drive a lot ) and figured if she does n't like it that 's ok , she can move on to another book . Myself , I love history . And I truly remember everything we learned in school about the holocaust , as well as watching shows on the history channel . Of course , when I was young I read `` The Diary of Anne Frank '' . It had been a very long time since I re-visited this topic . She loved it . I loved it . She learned . I learned . She cried . I cried . Elie Wiesel did a great job with this book .

Cinderella is not your run-of-the-mill enslaved beauty , the evil step-mother has some redeeming qualities , and the ugly step-sisters may be ugly , but they are rich in personality . Gone too are the fairy god-mothers , mice turned coachmen and magic that fades at midnight of the original fairy tale.The backdrop for the story is Harlem , a Dutch town in the 1630s at the height of the tulip craze . By the way , to find out more about the tulip craze , read the excellent book `` Tulipomania '' , by Mike Dash.Bottom line : this book is a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon .
