On a recent trip I wore it all weekend and it was so nice and easy . My shoulders did start getting sore after wearing my baby for several hours , but she is 22 pounds and I usually do n't wear her that long anyway . I love the pocket . I put my keys and cell phone in there when we go out for a walk . The only drawback is that after a few wearing sessions it stretches out and my baby hangs low , but I just wash and dry it to get it snug again . Not sure if I 'm supposed to wash AND dry it , but I do regularly and it 's held up well for a long time . Just recently I did notice it tearing a bit where the pocket is sewn on . When I wear my baby it does stretch that area quite a bit , and like I said I wash and dry it a lot which is n't that great for any fabric .", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "negative"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "This is my second potty purchase and I truly wished it had been my first .

Sometimes I ran the dishwasher 3-times a day JUST to clean bottles . I live in the desert , where water is precious . We pay handsomely for every drop that passes through our pipes . When I saw this sterilizer sitting on the shelf at Target , I snagged it.1 . ) It requires a small amount of water , and2 . ) It sanitizes in less than 10-minutes.I thought to myself , & # 65533 ; How can I go wrong ? & # 65533 ; This appliance is user friendly , so to speak.1 . ) There is NO way to confuse the stacking order : the base , the bottle rack , and the lid . There is no other way to put the thing together.2 . ) Loading can be confusing if the instructions are not followed . Keep the manual handy , as the loading order for large bottles , differs from the 4-ounce size.3 . ) Add the proper amount of water to the base every time . Do not skimp on the water , as it could cause the unit to burn . Do not over-fill it either , as the unit may not produce enough steam to work.That said ~ it & # 65533 ; s really quite simple to use . Pour 7-ounces of water in the base , load the rack , and pop it in the microwave . In 4 or 5-minutes it & # 65533 ; s done . Of course , it depends on the wattage of your microwave . Smaller microwaves may require more time , but that & # 65533 ; s all there is to it . I learned the hard way to wait before taking the sterilizer out of the microwave . It & # 65533 ; s HOT ! VERY hot ! Plus , any steam that & # 65533 ; s emitted can burn . The contents inside the unit will remain sterile for up to 3-hours given that the lid remains closed . Once the cooling time has passed , 2-minutes or so , remove the lid carefully . There will be lots of condensation on the bottles , similar to the dishwasher before the drying cycle begins . Place all the bits and pieces on a drying rack , or hand-dry them.When my son was a newborn , I used the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer at least 4-times a day . I cleaned bottles , nipples , breast pump parts , and pacifiers . Later on , I used the sterilizer on some of his toys . Be careful , not all toys are dishwasher safe . If it & # 65533 ; s top-drawer dishwasher safe , than it & # 65533 ; s probably sterilizer safe . We took many trips when William was an infant , and this unit made traveling easy . It provided a safe place to store the breast pump , and it worked in every hotel microwave we encountered . I don & # 65533 ; t recall exactly when I stopped using the sterilizer . It was probably soon after Will started solid foods . At any rate , this sterilizer was seriously tested in our home . I never had any problems , except the occasional burn to my hand when I opened the lid too early . Bad mommy , bad ! I can safely say the EXPRESS Microwave Steam Sterilizer was worth its weight in gold . Some might complain about the price of the sterilizer , but considering two , 9-ounce bottles come with the unit , it may seem more reasonable knowing they retail for $ 4.00 a piece .

They do an OK job preventing bubbles in the formula , but they have two main problems : 1 ) they tend to leak if you do n't assemble correctly , and also if shaken or if the membrane becomes a bit worn . 2 ) The design of the vent requires some negative pressure to allow the air to flow into the bottle . This means a slight resistance to your baby 's suckling effort . The last thing you want when addressing any feeding problem is resistance to your baby 's suckling.We found the most effective feeding design is the open airway used by Dr Browns bottles .

My niece had it before , so I knew it was a must-have with my little guy already . I love that he ( 1 year old ) can be exposed to fun classical music with a toy that engages him . He loves that it all lights up ( when the buttons on any side are pressed ) and he has fun pressing the buttons on the different sides and seeing and hearing the difference it makes ( pressing one side engages or unengages the instrument during the song ) . An added BIG PLUS for parents - it does have an `` off '' switch . : ) SO key , even for those of us who appreciate the value and fun of noisy kiddo toys ... there is still a time/place for quiet.Great , fun toy . : )", "qas": [{"question": "Is this sentence negative or positive?", "answers": [{"text": "positive"}]}]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"context": "We had the older model that was also round looking with two fish . My daughter loved it but the gears came off and it started clicking and the fish would n't move anymore . The square looking model was tacky looking to me so I was so happy to see this one now that I have a new baby b/c I thought it looked similar to the original model . The battery pack fell off the crib and broke the first time I tried to put it on . If you have a Next Generation or any other large , sleigh type crib.forget it . There is no way to attach it . I had to set it in a corner and tie the straps to the crib with fishing line . They need to make the straps way longer ( test this on different types of cribs ) .Next problem ... .it needs more water in front of the toys . It is obvious they are not in the water ( not a problem on the older model ) , it would make better bubbles too .

Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak . NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby 's face . Not only do you have to clean up but your baby does n't want to wait for a new bottle . After slowly running out of bottles that did n't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect ! They do n't leak and our baby has less gas . The liners prevent a lot of gas . If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price . You get 100 of them for maybe $ 5.00 . We have n't had any problems with leaking at all.So I do n't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time . But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer , warmer , & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them ! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that does n't mean they are all bad .

The biggest plus is it 's faster to prepare . The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process .
